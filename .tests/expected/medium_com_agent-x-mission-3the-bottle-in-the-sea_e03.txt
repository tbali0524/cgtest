I've been trying to piece together what happened, but it's all been a blur since they captured me. The Agency trained us for situations like this, but nothing could have prepared me for the reality of it. Death Island is as ominous as its name suggests. Surrounded by turbulent seas, it's a fortress designed to break even the strongest of wills. But I refuse to let them see me falter.The prison is crawling with guards, all armed to the teeth and vigilant. They think they've broken me, but I've been secretly gathering information, mapping out the layout, and identifying weak points in their security. It's not going to be easy, but I have a plan to escape. That's where you come in.I need you to assemble a team, the best of the best. You know who can handle this kind of heat. I've managed to hide a message in the lining of my cell - coordinates to a safe house on the mainland. Make your way
