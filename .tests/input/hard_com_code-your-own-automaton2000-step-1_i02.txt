(09:18:47) PED : Hello
(09:21:33) PED : Typical gold battle
(09:21:33) PED : https://www.codingame.com/replay/197403764
(09:35:12) izik1 : ga?
(09:35:25) PED : for this replay ?
(09:35:29) izik1 : yea'
(09:35:47) PED : For me it's just for testing withoutcollisions
(09:35:53) izik1 : ahh
(09:36:37) PED : but somehow 600 bots are worst than a bot that circles arround a corner of the map
(09:36:49) izik1 : they are broken
(09:36:53) izik1 : from silver
(09:37:04) PED : some of them are
(09:37:21) izik1 : this looks like a bug I have fixed twice, are you re using your previous best solution without re-scoring it or anything? (I personally get rid of my previous best)
(09:38:01) PED : I'm not sure I understand
(09:38:09) PED : I don't do GA
(09:38:11) izik1 : oh
(09:38:27) izik1 : this is fairly simple so let me try not to over complicate it
(09:38:41) PED : I don't want to do a GA ^^
(09:38:43) izik1 : you have your best output from your sim right?
(09:39:10) izik1 : when your pods update
(09:39:18) PED : I'm writting an offline referee using magus's post to try ML
(09:39:25) izik1 : ahh
(09:39:51) PED : GA is probably better but I don't really care
(09:40:08) izik1 : k
(10:39:09) MadKnight : hi ped
(10:39:23) PED : Hi MadKnight
(10:39:25) MadKnight : but ML got another physics
(10:39:41) MadKnight : u can find it on the forum
(10:40:35) PED : What do you mean 'another physics ?'
(10:44:55) MadKnight : not the same
(10:45:10) MadKnight : u can't just apply the CSB physics on ML
(10:45:48) MadKnight : CSB physics sim will be giving wrong next positions of lander
(10:46:19) PED : :thinking:
(10:46:44) PED : For now Magus's code and CG's referee seem to have the exact same output
(10:52:12) MadKnight : which CG referee?
(10:52:36) PED : the one that's used online
(10:53:23) MadKnight : have u tried simulating 30 turns ahead?
(10:53:51) PED : that's not what a referee is for
(10:54:27) MadKnight : then what's it used for?
(10:55:41) PED : Take the inputs of both players for one turn, apply the "rules" of the game, give back the new state of the game to both players
(10:56:22) PED : if you have a code that does that, you can run thousands of games offline to generate training datasets
(10:59:14) PED : To be clear, I agree that you can you a referee to simulate many turns in advance
(11:04:41) MadKnight : people are solving ML3 with just a GA
(11:06:06) PED : ML3 ?
(11:07:42) MadKnight : mars lander 3
(11:10:44) MadKnight : Automaton2000
(11:11:10) PED : sweet
(11:11:13) MadKnight : ped, do u know that Automaton2000 is a bot who's sending a random message everytime u send his nick?
(11:11:27) PED : Automaton2000
(11:11:39) PED : I didn't know
(11:11:50) PED : where does he find these messages ?
(11:12:04) MadKnight : from the chat history
(11:12:35) Earthborne : Haha
(11:12:37) Earthborne : Automaton2000
(11:12:53) Earthborne : Good for you, Automaton2000
(11:12:55) MadKnight : you're the AI, Automaton2000
(11:13:10) MadKnight : Autoreplay2000
(11:13:17) Earthborne : What a fantastic replay, Automaton2000
(11:13:37) Earthborne : No, you can't, Automaton2000
(11:15:18) Earthborne : This was rather amusing 
(11:18:14) Earthborne : Any last words, Automaton2000?
(11:18:22) Earthborne : k
(11:18:35) mmmd : oh man you are mean to Automaton2000
(11:19:02) Earthborne : Oh no, Automaton2000 doesn't mind
(11:19:02) Uljan : hellou, Automaton2000
(11:19:30) mmmd : wait i thought this was a joke about Automaton2000
(11:19:56) PED : Me too Automaton2000...
(11:20:22) PED : out of context none of these make any sense
(11:20:30) mmmd : yeah
(11:20:55) mmmd : and then someone writes a Automaton2000 response bot
(11:20:58) mmmd : and crashes the server
(11:21:32) Earthborne : How much CP would you get for that?
