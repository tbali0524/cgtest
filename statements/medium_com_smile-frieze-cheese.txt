If you try to fill a ribbon with a repetitive pattern, you will only find seven unique ways to do it due to symmetry.
The names of these symmetry classes (Frieze groups) are provided below with examples. Each class of patterns may include horizontal and vertical symmetries, 180° rotations, and glide-reflections. All patterns also include horizontal translations, they are omitted below.

{{p111}}: [[RRRRR]] No other transformations.
{{p1m1}}: [[DDDDDD]] A horizontal symmetry.
{{pm11}}: [[MMMMMM]] Vertical symmetries.
{{p112}}: [[SSSSSS]] Only rotations.
{{pmm2}}: [[HHHHHH]] Horizontal and vertical symmetries and rotations.
{{p1a1}}: [[pbpbpb]] Only glide-reflections.
{{pma2}}: [[A∀A∀A∀]] All transformations excepted horizontal symmetries.

You will be given a pattern in ASCII and you will have to find the mathematical name of the frieze.
Note that you will be given a full pattern, it won't be cut.
