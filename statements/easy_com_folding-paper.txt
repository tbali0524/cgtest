A contribution by VilBoub

A sheet of paper is folded several times. The goal is to determine how many layers of paper are visible from one side of the obtained folding.

Folding motions are:
{{R}} for Right: take the right side and fold it on the left side.
{{L}} for Left: take the left side and fold it on the right side.
{{U}} for Up: take the high side and fold it on the low side.
{{D}} for Down: take the low side and fold it on the high side.
