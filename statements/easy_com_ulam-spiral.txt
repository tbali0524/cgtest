The <<Ulam spiral>> or prime spiral is a graphical depiction of the set of prime numbers. It is constructed by writing the positive integers in a <<square spiral>> and specially marking the <<prime numbers>>.

You have to draw an Ascii representation of a Ulam spiral of size [[N]]×[[N]].
Use {{'#'}} for prime numbers.
Use {{' '}} for others.

<<Example with [[N]] = 3 :>>
There are positions for the 3×3 Ulam spiral
`5 4 3
6 1 2
7 8 9`
Start at the center and turn counterclockwise

Then replace prime numbers with {{'#'}} and the others with {{' '}} :
`#   #
    #
#    `
