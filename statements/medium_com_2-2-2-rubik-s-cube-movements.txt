You have to print the colours of the [[Front]] side of a 2×2×2 Rubik’s cube after some moves.
The colours are named by the first letter of each side ([[Front]], [[Back]], [[Right]], [[Left]], [[Up]], [[Down]]).
The moves are named the same way if you turn the side [[clockwise]].
For example [[F]] moves the [[Front]] side clockwise, [[F']] turns it anticlockwise and [[F2]] turns it twice. [[B]] turns it clockwise when you look at the [[Back]] side.
You won’t be given moves such as [[F5]], [[B52]] or [[U'3]].
