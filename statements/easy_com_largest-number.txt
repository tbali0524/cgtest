A contribution by MattDESTROYER

Given an input [[number]], output the largest number possible that follows these rules:
1. The output number must be divisible by [[D]]
2. The output number must be created by removing between 0 and 2 digits from the input [[number]] (you cannot change the order of the digits)
3. If it is not possible to make a number following the above rules, output 0

For example:
`314159
3`
Should output`31419`
