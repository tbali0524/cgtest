A contribution by Eldoir

You play battleship against your older sister, when an urgent desire is felt. You then ask your little brother to replace you temporarily. When you come back from your small business, it's up to your older sister to play.

Here is your mission, if you accept it:
- Check that your grid is valid (your little brother could have been wrong when placing the pieces!)
- Analyze the shot of your sister to determine the rest of the game.

The rules for checking the validity of the grid are as follows:
- Two ships can not touch each other vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
- There must be exactly <<1>> copy of these different ships:
    • Aircraft carrier (size <<5>>)
    • Cruiser (size <<4>>)
    • Counter-torpedoist (size <<3>>)
    • Submarine (size <<3>>)
    • Torpedoist (size <<2>>)

The grid is always a square of {{10}}×{{10}} boxes, the lines being numbered from {{1}} to {{10}} and the columns being numbered from {{A}} to {{J}}.
A little example:```  A B C
1 . . .
2 . . .
3 . . .```
A shot is always read beginning with the <<letter>>, for example: A5, H7, J10.
