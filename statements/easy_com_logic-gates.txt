A logic gate is an electronic device implementing a boolean function, performing a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and producing a single binary output.

Given [[n]] input signal names and their respective data, and [[m]] output signal names with their respective type of gate and two input signal names, provide [[m]] output signal names and their respective data, in the same order as provided in input description.

All type of gates will always have two inputs and one output.
All input signal data always have the same length.

The type of gates are :
<<AND>> : performs a logical <<AND>> operation.
<<OR>> : performs a logical <<OR>> operation. 
<<XOR>> : performs a logical <<exclusive OR>> operation.
<<NAND>> : performs a logical <<inverted AND>> operation.
<<NOR>> : performs a logical <<inverted OR>> operation.
<<NXOR>>  : performs a logical <<inverted exclusive OR>> operation.

Signals are represented with <<underscore>> and <<minus>> characters, an <<undescore>> matching a low level (0, or false) and a <<minus>> matching a high level (1, or true).
