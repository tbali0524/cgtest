You are given an undirected graph with weighted edges, a [[start]] and a [[goal]] node, and for each node the heuristic value, which is the estimated distance to the end. Your task is to trace a canonical A* execution (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm ) by computing a shortest path from the start to the goal.

We recall that the A* algorithm will rely on three values for each node [[v]]:
- the {{g-value}}, which is the minimum distance from the [[start]] to [[v]];
- the {{h-value}}, which is an estimation of the minimum distance from [[v]] to the [[goal]] and is given by the heuristic provided in input;
- the {{f-value}}, which is the sum of the g-value and h-value.

There is always a path between the start and the goal. The given heuristic is admissible and consistent, meaning that the A* algorithm will always find a shortest path from the start to the goal.

When some nodes have the same f-value, the one with the smaller identifier is considered first.
