Goal
A palindrome is a sequence of letters which reads the same backward as forward, like “madam” for example.

For a given input string S, you have to return the longest palindrome found within. If multiple substrings qualify, print them all in the same order as they appear in S.

Input
Line 1: A string S (only alphanumeric)

Output
N lines: Every longest palindrome contained in S

Constraints
0 < length of S < 10000

Example

Input
madam

Output
madam
