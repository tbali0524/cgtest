A contribution by [CG]Gaspar

Given a grid of mine locations (where {{.}} are empty cells and {{x}} are mines), your goal is to display the grid like it appears if you win the game.
Each position is a digit indicating the number of mines bordering it (including diagonals). The mines ({{x}}) don't appear anymore. Mines and positions that do not border any mines both appear as empty cells ({{.}}).
