As an FBI agent you intercepted a message from terrorists.
This message has to be decrypted, and to do so you have access to 2 pieces of information : P and C.

C is the alphabet used to write the message, and contains all the letters/characters needed to decode it.

P corresponds to the encoded value of the message.
Thankfully, you happen to know how this value is computed, and now need to reverse the following process :
 - Assuming the alphabet is 'abcd', each letter is associated to its index : a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, d = 3.
 - For the following values, a new letter is either added or switched :
   - aa = 4, ba = 5, ca = 6, da = 7
   - ab = 8, bb = 9, cb = 10, db = 11
   - ...
   - aaa = 20, baa = 21, caa = 22, daa = 23, and so on.
 - The whole message gets a unique value this way. For example with a full alphabet (26 letters) 'hello' would be 7073801.

Get it done agent ! (Good Luck)
