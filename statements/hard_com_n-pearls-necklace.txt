Goal
Mr. Burn and Mr. Side work in a necklace shop.
Mr. Burn makes the necklaces and Mr. Side sells them.
The necklaces are made with pearls of identical radius.
Sometimes, Mr. Burn launches a new collection: he chooses a panel of colors and a number of pearls and creates necklaces with these constraints.
Mr. Side is very dedicated to his job and whenever a new collection is launched, he displays all possible necklaces that follows the constraints of the collection in a glass case to offer the widest choice to the customers.

The necklaces are circular and reversible so the necklaces ABCDE, EABCD and EDCBA are the same necklace.
Also note that all colors of the panel must be used at least once.

For example if the constraints of the collection are:

number of pearls: 5 pearls
panel of colors: black and white,

then there are only 6 different necklaces:
WBBBB, WWBBB, WBWBB, WWWBB, WWBWB, WWWWB.

To help Mr. Side evaluate the size of the glass case, you must output the number of different necklaces for a given collection.

Input
Line 1: An integer N for the number of pearls.
Line 2: An integer C for the number of colors in the panel.

Output
Line 1: The number of different necklaces for a given collection.

Constraints
1 ≤ C ≤ N ≤ 30
