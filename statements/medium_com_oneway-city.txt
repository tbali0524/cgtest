Your city is a rectangular grid of buildings with streets joining them vertically and horizontally. 
All the streets are one way: you can only go either south or east, but never north or west.

Your program has to compute the number of routes linking the North-West corner to the South-East one in an [[M]] x [[N]] city grid.

Be warned however that OneWay City is in fact a Megalopolisâ€”with all the headaches that it implies. Actually, the numbers can get so big that your program's output should only contain the first 1000 digits of the solution.
