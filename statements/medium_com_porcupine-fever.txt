You have a hobby of visiting a porcupine farm. Porcupines are kept in cages and regularly fed. They are usually healthy and have been one of the rodents with longest lifespans, but <<some of these porcupines are sick>>.

Every year, each porcupines who were sick last year will <<cause {{2}} healthy porcupines>> in the same cage to be <<sick>>, and then <<die>>.

Simulate to find the <<total amount>> of surviving porcupines after every year. Stop if all the porcupines are dead (do not repeat {{"0"}}s after the first time).
