You must output a visual of the given <<binary tree>> of size [[N]].
A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children, called <<left child>> and <<right child>>.
A <<value>> is stored in each node.
Nodes have an id between 0 and [[N]] - 1 and are given in order.
The id of the root is always 0.
