A contribution by Darazdeblek

You are at the reception desk of a 4-floor hotel and a group of [[c]] customers arrive and ask for a room.

But what should have been a routine task becomes a nightmare when you realise they have very specific demands !

Your job is to assign a floor (from 0 to 3) for each of them while respecting their [[r]] rules.

There are 10 types of rules:

[[customer_name]] is at floor [[y]]        
[[customer_name]] is NOT at floor [[y]]    
There's nobody at floor [[y]]
There are exactly two customers at floor [[y]]
[[customer_name]] is alone at his/her floor
[[customer_name]] is with two other customers at his/her floor
[[customer_name]] is just above [[customer_name]]   
[[customer_name]] is higher than [[customer_name]]
[[customer_name]] is at the same floor as [[customer_name]]
[[customer_name]] is NOT at the same floor as [[customer_name]]

There is a unique solution for each test.

This puzzle is inspired by the boardgame Gamme Logic - HÃ´tel
