Decode a secret message.  Each message is encoded using something a little more complicated than a Caesar cipher.  Unlike a Caesar cipher which can be expressed as (X+A)%L, where A is the cipher variable and L is the length of the alphabet, this encoding instead is expressed as ((X+A)*B)%L.  A is the shift and B is the multiply.  Your task is to discover the secret message from an alphabet, an encoded message, and a word that is guaranteed to be in the secret message.

{{For this puzzle, the shift and multiply is not provided but the solution involves discovering it.  The shift and multiply may be different for every test case.}}

<<There is only one unique solution to each test>>

The first 4 test cases have B=1 and therefore can be solved using a simple Caesar cipher.
