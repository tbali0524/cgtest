Word Search is a type of puzzle that asks the player to search for various words within a grid of letters.
They can be vertical, horizonal, backwards, diagonal, etc.
If you are unfamiliar with it, see banner image and/or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search

But as a computer geek, that doesn't interest you; you want to program a way to find those words instead.

Input will be a square grid of [[size]] lines (each line is [[size]] letters long), followed by all the words to find.

Output the same square grid but hide any letters that aren't included in those words.
