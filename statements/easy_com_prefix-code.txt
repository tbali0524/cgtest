Given a fixed set of characters, a code is a table that gives the encoding to use for each character.

A prefix code is a code with the <<prefix property>>, which is that there is no character with an encoding that is a prefix (initial segment) of the encoding of another character.


Your goal is to <<decode>> an encoded string using the given prefix code, or say that is not possible.

Example of encoding.
Given the string {{"abracadabra"}} and the prefix code:
`a -> 1
b -> 001
c -> 011
d -> 010
r -> 000`The resulting encoding is: {{10010001011101010010001}}

Thus, if your are given the code above and the input {{10010001011101010010001}}, you should output the string {{"abracadabra"}}.

With the same prefix code, if the input is {{0000}}, then you should tell that there is an error at index 3. Indeed, the first three characters of this input can be decoded to give an 'r', but that leaves {{0}}, which cannot be decoded.
