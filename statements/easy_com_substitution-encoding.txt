You want to easily encode and decode messages with a simple and personalized method. To do so, you will use a substitution method.

The principle is simple, you have a comparison table like this one:

{{A B}}
{{C D}}

and a message to encode written with the characters available in your table:

{{CBA}}

You are going to take each of the characters that compose the message and replace them by its position in the table:

C => 10 (row 1 column 0)
B => 01 (row 0 column 1)
A => 00 (row 0 column 0)

The message becomes: {{100100}}
