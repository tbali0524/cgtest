You will get a representation of Wally and a Picture.

You must find Wally's position inside the picture. The top left corner of the picture is [[(x, y)]]={{(0,0)}}.

<<If Wally's representation contains spaces, the picture may contain others characters at these positions.>>

<<All non-space characters of Wally will be visible in the picture.>>
