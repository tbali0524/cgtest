Legend has it that the origin of the name "C#" was really just two "++" stacked on top of each other, like this
++
++ 
...and that formed a "sharp" (musical note symbol).  Cool, right?

C-Enterprises is considering releasing yet another programming language and their Marketing Department is in need of a logo for it that will play off that history, so it too will consist solely of plus-signs.  They have asked you to do some rough drafts for them.

Here is what they know they want:
~ They want just the <<outline>> of plus-signs
~ The outline itself will be done in plus-signs characters ({{+}})
~ When 2 plus-signs touch each other, the outlines separating the touching parts should disappear, so that it all "flows together"

They have not decided the following so these will be inputs in the various cases:
~ The [[size]] of the plus-signs
~ The [[thickness]] of the two-lines that form each plus-sign
~ The number and arrangement of the plus-signs

(You explain you are a programmer -- not a graphic artist -- but alas they insist.  So you just do your best, knowing the console application output will make the proportions appear a bit elongated.)
