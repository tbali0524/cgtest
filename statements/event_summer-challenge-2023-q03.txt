It's finally the day of admissions, today you'll be welcoming hundreds of mutants in your academy!
 
There are multiple data sources (recruitment agents, registration forms, ...) providing information about your students, and you would like to consolidate everything in a single file for administrative purposes.
 
Thankfully, each input file has been pre-converted to a common format, you just need to merge all of them.
 
The file format is organized in key/value pairs, with each line corresponding to a single student. Here's an example showing the format:
 
Name=John;Age=15;Power=Telepathy
Name=Mary;Age=16;Power=Glows in the dark;Team=Basketball
 
You will receive a list with the contents of several such files, and you need to produce a single file gathering everything they contain about each student.
 
You have a few guarantees on the input data:

Each mutant can be uniquely identified by their name.
Each line will contain the "Name" field.
There may be redundant information between files, but they will never contradict each other.
Keys and values can contain any printable ASCII characters except "=", ";" and line breaks (which are all used as separators)

Your output file should be formatted in the following way:
All mutants are sorted lexicographically by name.
The first field for each mutant is "Name", then all other fields lexicographically by key.
Note that these two constraints will not necessarily be respected by the input files.

CONSTRAINTS:
There will be at most 100 files
The total length of files is at most 1 million characters

EXAMPLE:
Let's assume you receive the following files.
File 1:
Name=John;Age=15;Power=Telepathy
Name=Mary;Age=16;Power=Glows in the dark;Team=Basketball
File 2:
Name=Adam;Age=17;Score=133;Power=Can turn anything into candy
Name=John;Score=283.5;City=NYC

Following the merging rules, the resulting file should contain exactly the following:
Name=Adam;Age=17;Power=Can turn anything into candy;Score=133
Name=John;Age=15;City=NYC;Power=Telepathy;Score=283.5
Name=Mary;Age=16;Power=Glows in the dark;Team=Basketball
