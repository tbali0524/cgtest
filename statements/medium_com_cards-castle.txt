Your goal is to determine if a card castle structure is stable or not.
You're given a 2D map composed of "." (dots), "/" and "\",  representing a card castle of height [[H]] and width {{H * 2}}.

A card castle is unstable if :
- a "/" card is missing before a "\" card (".\" is {{UNSTABLE}})
- a "\" card is missing after a "/" card ("/." is {{UNSTABLE}})
- two cards side by side have the same orientation ("//\" or "/\\" is {{UNSTABLE}})
- neither another card nor the ground are below (aka. a "flying card")
- the card below has the same orientation

The structure is {{STABLE}} if and only if all cards are {{STABLE}}.
