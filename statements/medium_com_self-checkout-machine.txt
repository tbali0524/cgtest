A contribution by Rob-G

You are tasked with creating a solution for how much change is required from a self-checkout machine based on the customer bill, the cash they put in and the available cash in that machine.

<<CHANGE>>
<<Notes:>> 50, 20, 10, 5
<<Coins:>> 2, 1, 0.50, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01

<<NOTATION>>
All [[cash]] in machine and [[output]] change to customer must be formatted in notation
1X20+2X10+5X1 =  1 of 20 note, 2 of 10 note and 5 of 1 coins. Total is 45.

You must always <<output>> the highest denomination of any notes & coins that is available.

<<EXAMPLE>>
Customer change = 50
Output will be: 2X20+1X10 (when available)

<<NOTES>>
Customers will always enter more than or equal cash for their bill.
Print {{ERROR: OUT OF MONEY}} if the machine cannot output the complete change required.
If you have a {{J}} in place of the count of note/coin, this means the machine will jam (but only when that note/coin is dispensed). In this case output {{ERROR: JAM}}
If there is an error of any kind, all other customers are <<NOT>> processed.
If no change is due output: {{0}}
