Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. At the end of the game, you have to determine which player is the winner by counting which one has the biggest territory.

Area scoring: A player's score is the number of stones that he has on the board, plus the number of empty intersections surrounded by that player's stones.

{{BLACK}} is always first so {{WHITE}} starts with 6.5 points also known as "komi".

Every board is in a stable position, you only have to calculate the territories.

Example (with only a 4x4 grid):

`
.BW.
BBWW
.BW.
BBWW
`
After transformation we have:

`
bBWw
BBWW
bBWw
BBWW
`

6B + 2b = 8 for BLACK
6W + 2w + 6.5(komi) = 14.5 for WHITE

WHITE is the winner.
