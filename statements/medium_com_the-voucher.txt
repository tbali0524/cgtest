Given a voucher and a list of products, find the number of combinations of products that match with the exact amount of money available on the voucher.

Rule : product can be picked 0, 1, 2 or 3 times.

Output : print the number of different combinations of products.

Example:
Given the list of products:
- bread 90
- green salad 115
- sugar 750g 95
- rice 500g 299

If I have an amount of 300 cents  on my voucher, I can only buy:
1 bread + 1 green salad + 1 bag of sugar => 90 + 115 + 95 = 300 cents 
So the answer is 1 combination of products.

All prices are in cents .
