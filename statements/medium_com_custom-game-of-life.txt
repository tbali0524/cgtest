You probably know the game of life, if you don't: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
It is a cellular automaton created by John Conway in 1970. An infinite grid made of dead and living cells that changes each turn following specific rules:
A living cell will survive only if it has 2 or 3 neighbours (<2: isolation death, >3: overpopulation death).
If a dead cell has exactly 3 neighbours, it comes back to life, else it stays dead.
[[neighbours]] is the number of neighbours with Moore neighbourhood (8 cells).

You will be given new rules and will have to adapt the evolution of the grid to these:
The first line is the condition of surviving of a living cell, and the second line is the birth condition of a dead cell. The index within the line is the number of neighbours, 0 to 8. Living is represented by {{1}}, dead by {{0}}.
Your goal is to output the grid given in input after [[n]] turns and with specific given rules.

<<Example: Classic rules>>
001100000   A living cell survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbours, and dies if 0,1 or 4+.
000100000   A dead cell is back to life if it has 3 neighbours, and stays dead if any other number.

A cell outside the grid will always be considered as dead.
