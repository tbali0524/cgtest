Your adventure path led you to an inn in a small, forgotten town somewhere to the North of Golem Hills.
After gulping the last drop from the 9th mug of elf wine a shady old man materializes out of nowhere, in-front of you.
You start to doubt the wine.
<<The old man (throwing a pack of old maps on the table):>> Do you want to earn some good coins?
<<You (without looking at him):>> I've enough for food and wine!
<<The old man:>> What about a whole inn...!
<<You:>> Hm...
<<The old man:>> Yeees and you'll get the glory of being the first one to get to this treasure!
<<You (looking at the bunch of maps):>> But they look the same!?
<<The old man:>> Or do they, you must choose wisely.
<<The voice of the old man (from nowhere):>> Ah right, one more thing, beware of the Dragons!
You grab your staff and sword, swallow one more whole mug of wine:
<<Well, it's glory time!>>

You are given [[N]] maps for a dungeon. Each map may contain a path to a treasure {{T}}, from starting position [ [[startRow]]; [[startCol]] ]. Determine the [[index]] of the map which holds the shortest path from the starting position to {{T}}, but be careful a map may lead you to a {{TRAP}}.

A path is marked on the map with {{^}}, {{v}}, {{<}}, {{>}} symbols, each corresponding to <<UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT>> directions respectively, i.e. each symbol shows you the next cell to move on.

A valid path must start from [ [[startRow]]; [[startCol]] ] and end on {{T}}.

The path length is the count of direction symbols plus {{1}}, for the {{T}} cell.

Example:
[[W]] = 4 [[H]] = 4
[[startRow]] = 1 [[startCol]] = 1
[[N]] = 3 

Maps:
`{{0}}
.>>v
.^#v
..#v
...T

{{1}}
....
.v#.
.v#.
.>>T

{{2}}
....
v<#.
v.#.
..>T`

In the above example map {{2}} does not contain a valid path from [{{1}}; {{1}}] to {{T}}, map {{0}} contains a valid path with length {{7}} (the count of the direction symbols + {{T}}) and map {{1}} contains a valid path with length {{5}}, so the answer is {{1}}.
