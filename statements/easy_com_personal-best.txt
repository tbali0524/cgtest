The puzzle input provides one or more gymnasts' names and competition categories, for example "{{Simone Biles}}" and "{{bars}}", following which will be a set of competition records. Each record contains a gymnast's name and the points they scored on the bars, the balance beam, and for floor work. There may be more than one competition record per gymnast.

The puzzle requires that you read through all the records, and find the highest score for each of the given gymnast/s in the given category/categories.
