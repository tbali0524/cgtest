A polydivisible number (or magic number) is a number with digits abcde... that has the following properties :

- Its first digit a is not 0.
- The number formed by its first two digits ab is a multiple of 2.
- The number formed by its first three digits abc is a multiple of 3.
- The number formed by its first four digits abcd is a multiple of 4.
- etc...

For example, 567 is polydivisible because :
- 5 is divisible by 1
- 56 is divisible by 2
- 567 is divisible by 3

Your program will have to determine in which bases the input number may be, knowing that it is polydivisible in base 10
