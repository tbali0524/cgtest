FizzBuzz is a problem that can be described with following rules:
For given [[f]] [[b]] [[n]] integers, in range from 1 to [[n]] inclusive, output:
* for multiples of [[f]] print {{Fizz}}
* for multiples of [[b]] print {{Buzz}}
* for multiples of [[f]] and [[b]] print {{FizzBuzz}}
* for other cases print the number

Given integer [[n]] and [[n]] lines of FizzBuzz output, find original [[f]] and [[b]] values.
