You are a treasure hunter.
Your goal is simple : Move on the map to collect the maximum amount of gold.

Given a map of height [[H]], width [[W]] and a starting position [[X]], you can move on 4 directions ( North, South, East, West ).
Each time you visit a cell, you collect the amount of gold indicated on it.
You Cannot visit a cell more than once !

The possible values for a cell are :
        - {{'X'}} : Your position
        - {{' '}} : Nothing - you can go through that cell, but there is no gold on it.
        - {{'#'}} : A wall - you cannot go through that cell.
        - [{{1}} - {{9}}] : The amount of gold on that cell.
