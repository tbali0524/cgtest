Goal
Placrates, the labyrinth engineer, is facing a simple puzzle. Given an h×w grid made of + and # characters, the objective to count the number of + characters in the leftmost column from which there exists a path to the rightmost column.

The path can be traced through a series of moves. Each move can be either horizontal or vertical, but not diagonal. Finally, valid moves pass through + characters only.

Input
Line 1 : The height h of the grid.
Line 2 : The width w of the grid.
Next h lines: The rows of the grid, where each row is composed of w space separated characters.

Output
Line 1 : The number of + characters in the leftmost column from which there exists a path to the rightmost column.

Constraints
2 ≤ h,w ≤ 12
