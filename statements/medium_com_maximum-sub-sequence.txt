Given a list of [[N]] random integers [[Ik]], you must return the maximum-length incrementing sequence contained in this list (for each [[Ik]] in the sequence, [[Ik]]=[[I(k-1)]]+1). The incrementing sequence must be ordered, but need not be adjacent in the given sequence.

In case of multiple maximum-length sequences, return the one with the lowest starting integer.
