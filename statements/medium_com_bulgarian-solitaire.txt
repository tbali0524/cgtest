In Bulgarian solitaire you are given piles of cards. In each turn you do 2 steps:
<<Step 1:>> Take a card from each pile. Piles with no cards are ignored.
<<Step 2:>> Make a new pile with the cards taken in Step 1.

You repeat the steps until you find a <<loop>>, meaning a configuration which has appeared previously. Again, piles with no cards are ignored. Also, ordering is not important, e.g. 1 card in the first pile and 2 cards in the second pile is considered the same as 2 cards in the first and 1 card in the second.

Card values are irrelevant.

The goal of this puzzle is to find the [[length]] of the loop (there is always a loop).

In the examples below, Turn 0 refers to the starting number of cards in each pile, and the other Turns refer to the number of cards in each pile (including a newly created pile) after each turn.

<<Example 1:>>

`Turn 0 | 3
Turn 1 | 2 1
Turn 2 | 1 0 2`
Ignoring ordering and piles with no cards, Turn 1 and Turn 2 show the same configuration of 1 2. The [[length]] of the loop is 1.

<<Example 2:>>

`Turn 0 | 1 3 3 4
Turn 1 | 0 2 2 3 4
Turn 2 | 0 1 1 2 3 4
Turn 3 | 0 0 0 1 2 3 5
Turn 4 | 0 0 0 0 1 2 4 4
Turn 5 | 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 3 4`
Ignoring ordering and piles with no cards, Turn 0 and Turn 5 show the same configuration of 1 3 3 4. The [[length]] of the loop is 5.

<<Example 3:>>

`Turn 0 | 1 0 5 1
Turn 1 | 0 0 4 0 3
Turn 2 | 0 0 3 0 2 2
Turn 3 | 0 0 2 0 1 1 3
Turn 4 | 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 4
Turn 5 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 3
Turn 6 | 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 3`
Ignoring ordering and piles with no cards, Turn 2 and Turn 6 show the same configuration of 2 2 3. The [[length]] of the loop is 4.
