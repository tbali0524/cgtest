The Master of Mayhem has unleashed a crew of cyborgs on the city, and may be disguised as one - but which one?

From surveillance reports we have determined that each cyborg is wearing a
{{hat}} and some {{neckwear}}, and has a {{companion}} and a {{catchphrase}}.

If Mayhem's hat is a <<FEDORA>>, then a cyborg wearing a <<BEANIE>> hat can't be the disguise. 
If you can eliminate all but one cyborg, that's Mayhem!

Mayhem has only been heard to utter one {{word}} from a {{catchphrase}}.

We might not know all the attributes of either Mayhem or the cyborgs.

Information about Mayhem and the cyborgs always follows one of these formats:

[[Name]]'s [[attribute]] is a [[string]]
[[Name]]'s [[attribute]] is an [[string]]
[[Name]]'s [[attribute]] is "[[string]]"

A [[string]] contains only letters and spaces.
