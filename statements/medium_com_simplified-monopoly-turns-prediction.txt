Your goal is to recreate a simplified turns prediction for the Monopoly™ game.

You'll be given a list of players with their names and their initial positions, a list of dice rolls, and a list of names of all the game board positions. You'll need to find the <<latest position>> for each player after all the given dice rolls.

<<GAME BOARD>>

The game is played on a <<circular>> game board.
There are 40 positions on the board, indexed from {{0}} to {{39}}.

<<BASIC RULES>>

Each player rolls two dice, and moves forward {{the sum of the dice rolled}} positions.
Multiple players can occupy the <<same>> position.
If a player reaches position {{39}} and still needs to move forward, he'll continue from position {{0}}. In other words, positions 38, 39, 0, 1, 2 are contiguous.
Unless something special happens (see below), his turn ends after moving.

<<DOUBLE RULES>>

A double refers to a roll where both dice have the same value.
If the player rolls a double, then he rolls the dice and moves again.
If the player rolls a double three times in a row, then he immediately goes to jail (see below) and his turn ends there.

<<JAIL RULES>>

The {{Visit Only / In Jail}} position has a dual nature: the player is either visiting only, or actually in jail, depending on how he got there.

If at the end of a basic move, the player lands on {{Go To Jail}}, then he immediately moves to the position {{Visit Only / In Jail}} and is in jail. His turn ends.
If the player rolls a double for the third time in a single turn, then he immediately moves to the position {{Visit Only / In Jail}} and is in jail. His turn ends.

If after moving, the player lands on {{Visit Only / In Jail}}, he is visiting only and is <<not>> in jail.

While the player is in jail, he still rolls the dice on his turn as usual, but doesn't move until either:
(a) he rolls a double, or
(b) he fails to roll a double for three throws (i.e. his previous two turns after moving to jail and his current turn).
If either (a) or (b) happens in the player's turn, then he moves forward {{the sum of the dice rolled}} positions and his turn ends. He doesn't roll the dice again even if he has rolled a double.

<<Note:>> {{Visit Only / In Jail}} is at position {{10}}. {{Go To Jail}} is at position {{30}}.
