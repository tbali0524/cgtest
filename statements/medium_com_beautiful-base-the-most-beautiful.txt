Goal
Let n be a positive integer. A "beautiful base" of n is any integer b > 1 such that log_⁡b(n) is an integer > 1, where log_b(n) denotes the logarithm of n in base b.

Find the beautiful base B of n such that log_⁡B(n) is as large as possible. We shall refer to B as the "most beautiful base" of n.

Input
