You are given a grid of letters and a list of words.

Strike the words in the grid. They can be written horizontally, vertically or diagonally, possibly reversed (in any direction) but always in a straight line. Each word is found only once in the grid, although they may overlap.
A few letters will remain unstruck. Write them down, from left to right, top to bottom, and find the secret word.
