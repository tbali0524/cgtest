You get a <<sudoku grid>> from a player and you have to check if it has been correctly filled.

A sudoku grid consists of 9×9 = 81 cells split in 9 sub-grids of 3×3 = 9 cells.
For the grid to be correct, each row must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9), each column must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9) and each sub-grid must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9).

You shall answer {{true}} if the grid is correct or {{false}} if it is not.
