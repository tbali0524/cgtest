Find the shortest unique prefixes for each word of the given list of words.

That should look familiar for those who handled switches for their command-line scripts or maintained their completion tables.

<<Example>>

You are given a list of six different words: {{alphabet}}, {{book}}, {{carpet}}, {{cadmium}}, {{cadeau}}, {{alpine}}.

In this list, you can see that:
* only one word starts with the letter {{b}}, so its shortest prefix will be {{b}}
* two words start with the letter {{a}}, but also both continue with {{lp}} so their respective shortest prefixes will be {{alph}} and {{alpi}} ({{h}} and {{i}} making the differentiation)
* three words start with the letter {{c}}, but also continue with some common letters, like {{a}} for all of them, and then {{d}} for only two of them, so their respective shortest prefixes will be {{car}}, {{cadm}} and {{cade}}

<<Notes>>

* The prefixes will not necessarily be of the same length.
* A word can be given several times in the given list. All the occurences of this word will share the same prefix.
* Each given different word must have a distinctive prefix from the prefixes of the other given words.
* A prefix cannot be used by two different words.
* If a word shares all its prefixes with the other different words, then, to avoid starvation, its prefix will be itself, and all its prefixes cannot be used by other words.
* You can read detailed definition of prefix in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_operations#Prefixes
