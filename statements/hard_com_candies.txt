Goal
Terry loves candies.
He just got a new batch of candies and he's wondering about how he should eat them.

Terry is trying to eat those N candies and he can put up to K candies in his mouth at once.
What are the possibilities for Terry to eat his candies ?

For example, let's say Terry wants to eat 3 candies and that he can put in his mouth up to 2 candies :
He can just eat 1 candy three times in a row.
He can eat 1 candy, and then 2.
Or, he can also eat 2, and then eat 1.

The output should then be :
1 1 1
1 2
2 1

Input
Two integers separated by a space: N the number of candies, K the size of Terry's mouth.

Output
The possibilities need to be sorted using the lexicographical order.
For each possibility :
A line of integers separated by spaces : The possibility, i.e. the numbers of candy that Terry puts in his mouth at each step.

Constraints
N ≤ 10
K ≤ 10

Input
1 1
