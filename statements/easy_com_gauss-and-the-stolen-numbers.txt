Goal
You are young Gauss, and your teacher wrote the natural numbers from 1 to N on the board.
When the class went out for lunch, two numbers mysteriously disappeared!

All that remains are:

• the sum of the remaining natural numbers

• the sum of their squares

Your task is to find the two missing natural numbers.

Input
Line 1: An integer N representing the largest natural number written on the board.
Line 2: An integer S — the sum of the remaining natural numbers.
Line 3: An integer Q — the sum of squares of the remaining natural numbers.

Output
Line 1: Two space-separated integers — the missing natural numbers, in ascending order.

Constraints
2 ≤ N ≤ 1 000 000
All given values fit within 64-bit signed integers.
