During World War II, the Germans were using an encryption code called Enigma â€“ which was basically an encryption machine that encrypted messages for transmission. The Enigma code went many years unbroken. Here's How the basic machine works:

First Caesar shift is applied using an incrementing number:
If String is {{AAA}} and starting number is {{4}} then output will be {{EFG}}. 
`{{A + 4 = E}}
{{A + 4 + 1 = F}}
{{A + 4 + 1 + 1 = G}}`
Now map {{EFG}} to first ROTOR such as:
`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
BDFHJLCPRTXVZNYEIWGAKMUSQO`So {{EFG}} becomes {{JLC}}. Then it is passed through 2 more rotors to get the final value.

If the second ROTOR is {{AJDKSIRUXBLHWTMCQGZNPYFVOE}}, we apply the substitution step again thus:
`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
AJDKSIRUXBLHWTMCQGZNPYFVOE`So {{JLC}} becomes {{BHD}}.

If the third ROTOR is {{EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ}}, then the final substitution is:
`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ`So {{BHD}} becomes {{KQF}}.

Final output is sent via Radio Transmitter.
