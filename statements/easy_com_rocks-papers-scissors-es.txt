[[n]] opponents, all standing in a circle around you (clockwise from player {{0}} to [[n]]{{-1}}), have challenged you to games of "Rock, Paper, Scissors" at the same time. So confident are these players, that they have all shown their moves, and are waiting for you to respond. 

You have to win as many of the games as you can, by playing a single move (either {{Rock}}, {{Paper}}, or {{Scissors}}) against an opponent of your choice (player {{0}} to [[n]]{{-1}}), then playing the <<same move>> against the next player clockwise, and proceeding round the group until you lose a round, or you've played everybody.

- You may start with any opponent, but you must win the first game.
- After the first win, play the same move against each following opponent in the circle, until you lose a game, or until you have played every opponent.
- A draw does not count as a win, or as a loss.
- If there is more than one possible play with the maximum number of wins, the play starting from the lower-numbered opponent takes priority.

For anyone who never played the game: 
{{Rock}} beats {{Scissors}}
{{Scissors}} beats {{Paper}}
{{Paper}} beats {{Rock}}

<<EXAMPLE>>
`6
Scissors
Paper
Rock
Paper
Scissors
Rock`
The players surround you, and declare their moves:

`    0=S
5=R     1=P
    YOU
4=S     2=R
    3=P`
Starting at {{0}}, you play {{Rock}} - you win 1 before losing to {{Paper}}
Starting at {{1}}, you play {{Scissors}} - you win 1 before losing to {{Rock}}
Starting at {{2}}, you play {{Paper}} - you win 1 and draw 1 before losing to {{Scissors}}
Starting at {{3}}, you play {{Scissors}} - you win 1 and draw 1 before losing to {{Rock}}
Starting at {{4}}, you play {{Rock}} - you win 1, draw 1, win 1 before losing to {{Paper}}
Starting at {{5}}, you play {{Paper}} - you win 1 before losing to {{Scissors}}

<<Solution:>>
`Rock
4`

Difficulty
Easy
