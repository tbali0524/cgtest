Goal
A driver is on a road network with n junctions and m roads with two specific positions s and t.
Each junction of the network can be associated with a time window [b,e] : the driver can go through that intersection only between times b and e. Every other junction is free : the driver can cross it at any time. Each road is associated with a duration: the time a car needs to drive through that road. The roads are directed : the car cannot go through a road backwards.

Your goal is to decide if a driver can go from s to t such that, for each junction associated with a time window [b,e], the moment r when the driver reaches that junction belongs to its window : b <= r <= e. If the junction has no time window, the driver can reach it at any time.

The driver starts in s at time 0.
The driver cannot wait. Once he reaches a junction, he must go though an outgoing road of that junction.
The time windows are always closed intervals.

Here is an example where <, >, ^ and v represent roads (and the directions).

s > u > w > t

v   ^   v   ^

x > y > z > r


The time window on x, u and y is [1,2].
The time window on w, z and r is [3,5].
The time window on t is [1,7].
The duration on each arc is 1.


It is possible to go from s to t with that path.

s           t

v           ^

x > y > z > r


The driver would be in x at time 1, y at time 2, z at time 3, r at time 4 and t at time 5. Each time fits within the specified time window.

In this example with the same time windows and same durations :

s > u > w > t

v   ^   v   ^

x > y   z > r


You cannot go from s to t, because you must go through w in order to reach t and it is not possible to be in w between time 3 and 5 and in u between time 1 and 2:
- either the driver goes from s to u and arrives at w at time 2;
- or it uses the path s x y u w and arrives at u at time 3.

Input
Line 1 : Three integers n, m and ntw the number of junctions and roads in the network and the number of junctions with a time window. The junctions are numbered from 0 to n-1.
Line 2 : Two integers s and t, the origin and the destination of the driver
ntw next lines : three integers v, b and e, a junction v, the beginning and the end of the time window of that junction.
m next lines : three integers u, v and d, the origin, the destination and the duration of each arc.

Output
Line 1 : print true if there is a path from s to t satisfying the time windows constraints. Otherwise, print false.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 10
1 <= m <= 20
0 <= e - b < 10
0 <= e, b <= 50
0 <= d <= 25
