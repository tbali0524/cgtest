Your goal is to count how many fish you have caught.
You are fishing in a water with an altitude of [[H]]
and a length of [[W]] and a current
pointing towards [[currentD]] with a very cheap fishing rod,
It is broken by touching any garbage, but at least it is used to catch fish.

<<INFORMATION: >>
<<*>> ".": water
<<*>> ">": a fish that goes to the right
<<*>> "<": a fish that goes to the left
<<*>> "|": fishing rod
<<*>> "C": hook. If it is just below the fishing rod or if it is the first "C" in the first row and there is no "|", it is considered to be the fishing rod, otherwise it is garbage.
<<*>> any other character: garbage

<<RULES:>>
<<1. Fishing rod:>>
<<*>> Fish can touch any part of your fishing rod to be caught
<<*>> If the trash touches the fishing rod it breaks (you can not fish anymore)
<<*>> If garbage and fish touch the fishing rod at the same time, fish is caught (and then the rod breaks)
<<*>> There always has to be a hook

<<2. Fish:>>
<<*>> Fish can move in both directions regardless of the current
<<*>> If two fish collide with each other, they get stuck (they stop moving and disappear)
<<*>> The fish die when colliding with the garbage (the fish and garbage stop moving and disappear)

<<3. Garbage:>>
<<*>> Trash moves in the direction of the current
