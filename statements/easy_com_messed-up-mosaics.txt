I ordered beautiful mosaics online.
They were cheap, but they all came with the same issue: <<one single tile is not the good one>>.

Can you help me locate the wrong tile in each mosaic?

 Each mosaic is made of [[N]] * [[N]] <<tiles>>.
Given a [[pattern]] of tiles that repeats to form a [[mosaic]] and the [[mosaic]] itself, you have to find the [[coordinates]] of the tile that doesn't fit the [[pattern]].
The origin of the [[coordinates]] is at the top left corner of the [[mosaic]].
