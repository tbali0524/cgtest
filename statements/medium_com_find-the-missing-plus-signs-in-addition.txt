The sum of a set of [[N]] integers is [[S]].
Unfortunately, the plus signs have disappeared and the integers have been concatenated in a string [[O]]...
You have to find the positions of the plus signs to recover the addition.
If there is no solution , then print {{No solution}}, otherwise print the solution(s) in lexicographic order ( 1+11 before 11+1 ).
