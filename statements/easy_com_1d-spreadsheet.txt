You are given a 1-dimensional spreadsheet. You are to resolve the formulae and give the value of all its cells.

Each input cell's content is provided as an [[operation]] with two operands [[arg1]] and [[arg2]].

There are 4 types of operations:
{{VALUE}} [[arg1]] [[arg2]]: The cell's value is [[arg1]], ([[arg2]] is not used and will be "_" to aid parsing).
{{ADD}} [[arg1]] [[arg2]]: The cell's value is [[arg1]] + [[arg2]].
{{SUB}} [[arg1]] [[arg2]]: The cell's value is [[arg1]] - [[arg2]].
{{MULT}} [[arg1]] [[arg2]]: The cell's value is [[arg1]] × [[arg2]].

Arguments can be of two types:
• <<Reference>> $[[ref]]: If an argument starts with a dollar sign, it is a interpreted as a reference and its value is equal to the value of the cell by that number [[ref]], 0-indexed.
For example, "$0" will have the value of the result of the first cell.
Note that a cell can reference a cell <<after>> itself!

• <<Value>> [[val]]: If an argument is a pure number, its value is [[val]].
For example: "3" will have the value {{3}}.

There won't be any cyclic references: a cell that reference itself or a cell that references it, directly or indirectly.
