Queneau Numbers were discovered by the French writer and mathematician Raymond Queneau, while member of the OULIPO.

A Queneau Number is a number [[N]] such that the sequence [1..N] can go through a series of spiral permutations (or "snail" permutations) and come back to [1..N] in exactly N iterations. The permutation consists in tracing a spiral from the last number of the sequence, spiraling towards the center. 
You can visualize it for the sequence 1 2 3 4 5 :
1←←←←5 
1→→→45 
12←←45
12→345
thus [1 2 3 4 5] becomes [5 1 4 2 3]


For instance, 5 being a Queneau Number, the permutations will start from the sequence

`1,2,3,4,5`

And go as follows:

`5,1,4,2,3`
`3,5,2,1,4`
`4,3,1,5,2`
`2,4,5,3,1`
`1,2,3,4,5`

The Nth line is always the same as the initial sequence, or else the number is <<not>> a Queneau Number.

Erratum: Actually, a Queneau number should be such that the order of the permutation is exactly N, (i.e the sequence [1..N] cannot become [1..N] again before exactly N spiral permutations).
In this problem, all numbers such that [1..N] is still [1..N] after N spiral permutations are considered valid even if it might take less than N spiral permutations to encounter [1..N]
