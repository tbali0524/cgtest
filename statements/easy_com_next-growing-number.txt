A growing number is a number where each digit, from left to right, is greater than or equal to the previous one.

Given a number [[n]], which may or may not be a growing number, you have to find the first growing number > [[n]].

<<Example:>> 
With <<n = 19>>, the first  growing number greater than [[n]] is <<22>>, because both <<20>> and <<21>> have a second digit that is smaller than the first one.
 
<<Note:>> This problem can be solved without converting [[n]] to a number.
