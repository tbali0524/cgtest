Story:
Louise is learning calculus in her maths courses and she likes the idea. When doing her homework, she is not sure and she wants to check her answers with yours. Could you create a program so that we can check the answers?

Calculate, evaluate the partial derivative of a given formula.

For instance, 
given the function formula "(5*(x*(y^2)))"                              
and "y x", the variables in respect with you must derive it
So here f(x,y) = 5xy²
and you have to calculate:
```    d²f(x,y)
   ----------
     dxdy```
it gives you the formula 10*y,
At last "x 2 y 6" means x=2, y=6,
gives you the values with which you must evaluate the obtained derivative
So the answer should be 60

Note:

To simplify the task, only consider {{+}}, {{*}} and {{^}}. And assume that {{+}}, {{*}} and {{^}} always take two arguments and that expressions are fully parenthesized. 

Negative power has no parenthesis. 
e.g. (((18*(x^{{-1}}))+y)+z)

[[var]]s may be in other forms other than x, y, and z. Similar to identifiers in many programming languages, the [[var]] would be some letter followed by letters, numbers or underscore.

link about calculus rules: <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_rules>>
The rules needed here:
a'=0
(a*x)'=a
(x^a)'=a*x^(a-1)  (when a is not 0)
(u+v)'=u'+v'
(u*v)'=u'*v+v'*u
