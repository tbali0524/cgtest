A virus is installed in one of the nodes of a network. The goal is to protect the largest possible part of the network from the virus by placing a firewall on a single node that the virus cannot traverse. 
You must output the optimal location of the firewall. You cannot place your firewall on an infected node. 

NOTE: The virus can spread through any link in the network. Solutions are unique, no tiebreaking is needed.
