A contribution by Witman

John has to draw a lot of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides. 
More precisely, John has got two numbers [[a]] and [[b]] and he must draw regular polygons with the number of sides:<< a, a+1, a+2, ..., b-2, b-1, b>>.

For example, if [[a]] = 3 and [[b]] = 6, John must draw an equilateral triangle, a square, a regular pentagon, and a regular hexagon.

Because John wants to do the job precisely, he intends to draw as many polygons as possible by geometric constructions (it means using only a straightedge and compass).

Based on Gauss–Wantzel theorem we know that:
A regular <<n-gon>> (that is, a polygon with <<n>> sides) can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if <<n>> is the product of a power of 2 and any number of distinct Fermat primes (including none).
A Fermat prime is a prime number of the form <<2^(2^m)+1>>. Where <<m>> is a natural number. 

Help John and write a program that will calculate how many polygons from the given range can be drawn using geometric construction.
