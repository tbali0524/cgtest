Imagine you have a bag, which is filled with [[N]] balls. Each ball can have the color <<black>> or <<white>>.  You know that [[W]] balls in the bag are white.

If you extract a ball from the bag, the probability changes of the remaining balls.

Your job is it to output the ratio of the odds that you extracted [[k]] white balls after extracting [[s]] balls from the bag.
Balls are never put back into the bag!

<<Example:>>
You have 3 balls in the bag, 2 of which are white.
What is the probability of having 2 white balls by extracting 2 balls? `2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3`
When <<A>> is the event of getting 2 white balls:
P(A) = Probability of getting 2 white balls = <<2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3>>
P(!A) = Probability of not getting 2 white balls = <<1-1/3 = 2/3>>

So the ratio P(A) : P(!A) is  <<1:2>> (read 1 to 2).

The ratio <<2:4>> would be the same ratio, but both numbers are divisible by <<2>>, so you need to reduce the ratio.
