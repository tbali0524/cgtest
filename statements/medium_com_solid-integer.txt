We call an integer solid if it is positive and we do not need to use the digit 0 to write it down in base 10.
For example, 115 is solid, but 10 and 1205 are not.
The 10th solid integer is 11 because the first 10 solid integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11.
For each value of [[n]], you have to compute the [[n]]th solid integer.
