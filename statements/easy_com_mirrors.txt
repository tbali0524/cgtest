When {{z}} units of light shine on any side of a mirror with reflectivity {{r}}, {{rz}} units of light are reflected, and the other {{(1-r)z}} units of light pass through the mirror. 
There are [[n]] mirrors numbered 1...[[n]] arranged in a row. Mirror [[i]] has reflectivity [[r_i]]. Find the total amount of light reflected back to the source when {{1}} unit of light shines on the first mirror. 
Note that light can be reflected multiple times.
