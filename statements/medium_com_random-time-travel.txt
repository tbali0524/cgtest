A linear congruential generator (LCG) is a pseudorandom number generator algorithm defined by the recurrence relation:
`lcg(seed) = (a * seed + c) % m`
LCGs are notably used by Java's Math.random(). It is sometimes useful to be able to check the value given by the random number generator a number of steps in the future or in the past, given the current internal seed of the LCG.

You are given the [[seed]], the parameters [[a]], [[c]] and [[m]] of an LCG and the number of [[steps]].

If [[steps]] is positive you must return the result of the composition of the lcg function [[steps]] times.
`lcg(lcg(...lcg(seed)))`
If [[steps]] is negative you must return the result of the composition of the reverse of the lcg function.
 `lcg^-1(lcg^-1(...lcg^-1(seed)))`

Hint: The reverse of an LCG is also an LCG. The composition of two LCGs is also an LCG.
