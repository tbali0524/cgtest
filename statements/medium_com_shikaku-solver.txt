<<Find all solutions to a Shikaku puzzle.>>

Shikaku is a puzzle played on a rectangular grid. Some of the squares in the grid are numbered. The objective is to divide the grid into rectangular pieces such that each piece contains exactly one number, and that number represents the area of the rectangle.

If the puzzle is poorly designed, there might be more than one solution. The goal here is to find all the solutions to a given puzzle.

We will use the letters ({{A}}-{{Z}},{{a}}-{{z}}) to represent the rectangles. Going left to right then top to bottom, you should encounter the rectangles ({{A}}-{{Z}},{{a}}-{{z}}) in order.
