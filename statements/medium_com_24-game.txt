<<Info/Rules>>
The 24 puzzle is an arithmetical puzzle in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. For example, for the numbers 4, 7, 8, 8, a possible solution is (7-8/8)*4 = 24 - Wikipedia

You are given 4 integers, each ranging from 0-13. Determine whether it is possible to achieve the number 24 using only parenthesis, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division while including every single given integer in your calculations.
