Given an ASCII drawing of [[N]]x[[M]] characters. You must output the longest snake size in the image. It is also necessary to output the number of snakes with such size.

On the field "{{.}}" means an empty space (no snake)

The snake is depicted by the following constant symbols:

"{{o}}" - a snake's head
"{{-}}","{{|}}" - intermediate part of the snake in horizontal/vertical position
"{{v}}","{{<}}","{{>}}","{{^}}" - a snake's tail
"{{*}}" - a curved part of the snake, i.e. a turn. Example:
{{```
..*-o
..|..
*-*..
|....
v....```}}

<<It is guaranteed>> that it's possible to unambiguously determine which symbol refers to which snake:

The second character from the head and from the tail <<cannot be>> a "{{*}}".
Also, one snake <<cannot have two "{{*}}"s in a row>>.
