Goal
You are given a device with a display and three buttons: +1, -1, and ×2. The display starts at 0.

Calculate the minimum number of button presses required to display an integer n.

Rules:
- The device cannot display negative numbers.
- Pressing -1 when the displayed number is 0 will cause the device to malfunction. Avoid this situation.
