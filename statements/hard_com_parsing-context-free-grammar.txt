Topic: Context-free grammars, CYK algorithm, dynamic programming

Given the context-free grammar and a set of words, your task is to decide which words belong to the language defined by that grammar.

The grammar is presented in Chomsky normal form, without epsilon-rules. Non-terminal symbols are always uppercase letters, terminal symbols are always lowercase letters.

Input
Line 1: the number N of rules in the grammar
Line 2: the character START indicating the start symbol
Next N lines: rules of the grammar
Next line: the number T of testcases
Next T lines: words to parse

Output
T lines containing true if word can be successfully parsed by the grammar, false otherwise.

Constraints
0 < number of terminal symbols < 25
0 < number of nonterminal symbols < 25
0 < N < 100
0 < T < 100
0 < length of word < 100

Example

Input
6
S
S -> SS
S -> OT
T -> SC
S -> OC
O -> a
C -> b
10
ab

abba
ababab
aaabbb
abaabb

aaabababbb
aababababbb
aaabababbabb

Output
