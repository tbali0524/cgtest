The Goal
Help the car to reach the target tile.

Rules
You are given a board with solid ground tiles, void cells, a car and floating platforms. You can navigate the car as well as the platforms. The car will always move by exactly one cell at a time. The platforms move, until they hit a solid cell or another platform. Platforms can only move in certain directions. If the car is on a platform, they will both move together.

Advanced Details
It is possible to move a platform out of the game, into orbit. Every map is solvable without doing so, but for some maps such an action can make it easier to solve.
You can see the game's source code on https://github.com/eulerscheZahl/SpaceJam.
Victory Conditions
The car reaches the target cell
Loss Conditions
The car gets lost in space by moves on a void cell or by sending a platform with the car on it into orbit
You don't reach the target cell within 200 turns.
You do not respond in time or output an unrecognized command.

Initial input
Line 1: width: the width of the board
Line 2: height: the height of the board
Next height lines: the grid. A cell can be:
# for a void cell
. for a ground cell
0 for the target cell (exactly one such cell exists)

Turn input
Line 1: entityCount, the number of entities in the game
Next entityCount lines: id, x, y, directions
directions is either CAR for the car, or a combination of the letters U, D, R and L.
There are 7 different types of platforms: U, D, R, L, UD, RL, UDRL.

Output
A single line containing an id and direction (U, D, R or L) to indicate what and where to move.

Constraints
2 ≤ entityCount ≤ 10
width = 19
height = 10
Response time ≤ 1000 ms for the first turn, 50 ms for every turn after
200 turns to reach the target
