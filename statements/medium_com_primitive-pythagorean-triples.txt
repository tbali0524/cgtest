In this problem, we are given an input integer [[N]], and your goal is to find the number of all <<primitive>> Pythagorean triples up to and including [[N]].

A Pythagorean triple is a triple ([[a]], [[b]], [[c]]), where [[a]], [[b]] and [[c]] are positive integers such that [[a]]² + [[b]]² = [[c]]². We want to find the number of all of these triples, such as {{0}} < [[a]], [[b]], [[c]] ≤ [[N]], with [[a]] < [[b]] < [[c]] and exclude any multiples of other triples. For example, we do not want to count the triple ({{6}}, {{8}}, {{10}}), since it is a multiple of the triple ({{3}}, {{4}}, {{5}}).
