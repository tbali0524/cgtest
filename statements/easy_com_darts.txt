A contribution by WilliamMorrison

A group of your friends want to have a dart throwing competition with a unique target. They've asked you, their tech savvy friend, to automate the scoring as they often squabble over scoring, and have trouble keeping track of who's turn it is to throw.

The target is a square. The square has a circle inscribed within whose diameter matches the width of the square. The circle, in turn, encompasses a diamond whose width from corner to corner matches the circle's diameter. The diamond can be thought of as a square rotated by 1/4 PI so that the corners of the square are on the x and y axes.

Darts landing within the square but not within the circle or diamond are worth 5 points. Darts landing within the circle but not within the diamond are worth 10 points. Darts landing within the diamond are worth 15 points.

In the event of a tie, competitors should be ordered as they were in the name list, so competitors appearing earlier in the name list are listed earlier in ties.

Note: Darts landing on the edge of a shape are considered within the shape.
Note: The center of the square, circle and diamond is at (0,0).
