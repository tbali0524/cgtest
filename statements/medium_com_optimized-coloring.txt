Goal
Having an empty sheet of paper divided in some zones, try to fill these zones with as few colors as possible, respecting the following rule : two adjacent zones must be filled with two different colors.

Two zones are considered as adjacent if they share, at least partially, a border.

For instance, these pairs of zones are adjacent :
+---+         +---+
|   +---+     |   |
+---|   |     +-+-+-+
    +---+       |   |
                +---+


Warning : two zones touching diagonally are not adjacent.

For instance, these zones are not adjacent :
+---+
|   |
+---+---+
    |   |
    +---+

You have to find the minimum number of colors necessary to fill all the zones.
Input
Line 1: an integer w representing the width of the sheet of paper
Line 2: an integer h representing the height of the sheet of paper
h following lines : a string representing one line of the sheet of paper
Output
