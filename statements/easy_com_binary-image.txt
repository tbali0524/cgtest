You are going to write a simple program to decode some arrays of data into a black-and-write graphic.

The graphic is composed of [[n]] lines of black and white pixels. We use {{.}} to represent a white pixel; {{O}} to represent a black pixel.

For example, here is one line of graphic
<<....OOO.>>

We shall encode it into an array {{4 3 1}} 
because it starts with {{4}} whites, then {{3}} blacks, then {{1}} white.
We assume most lines shall start with white.

When there is a line starting with black, we add {{0}} at the beginning of the encoded data, to say there is no white pixel before the first black pixel.
For example
{{OO.OOOOO}}
will be encoded into {{0 2 1 5}}.

You must output {{INVALID}} if the graphic is not rectangular (this doesn't mean the input lines should be the same length, but the outputs lines should be).

In this puzzle, you will be given [[n]] lines of encoded data.
You are going to decode it into a graphic.
