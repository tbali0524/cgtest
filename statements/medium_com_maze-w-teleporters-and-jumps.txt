Your goal is to find the minimum amount of steps from start to end in a maze with teleporters and jumps and return {{-1}} if it's not possible to reach the end.

You will be given a maze with [[width]] x [[height]] cells
With symbols:
{{#}}: wall
{{_}}: empty cell
{{S}}: starting point
{{E}}: ending point
{{lowercase letter}}: teleporter entry
{{UPPERCASE letter}}: teleporter exit
{{<}}, {{>}}, {{^}}, {{v}}: jump pod

How teleporters work: {{x}} -> {{X}} meaning when you step on the {{x}} you will be teleported to {{X}}. This does <<not>> mean when you walk over the {{X}} that you will be teleported to {{x}}.
How jump pods work: when you step on it, you jump 2 steps in the direction of the sign. You also jump over walls, but there won't be any out of bounds jump pods. Example: stepping on the {{>}} will make you jump 2 steps to the right, {{<}} to the left, {{^}} up, and {{v}} down. Letter {{v}} will not be used as a teleporter.

Allowed moves are Up, Down, Left and Right, no diagonal moves.
