Someone just told you all roads lead to Rome.
As a matter of fact, this is not true.
In order to restore scientific truth, you must write a program that counts the actual number of paths from <<Paris>> to <<Rome>>, where cities are visited <<at most once>>.
To start with, you are given a collection of all paths that directly connect two individual cities and where each city is defined by a number from 1 to 100. <<Paris>> has <<label 1>>, and <<Rome>> has <<label 100>>.
One may use paths <<both ways>>.

Let us illustrate the problem with a simple example: 
you are given 5 paths:

1 50
50 100
25 50
75 25
100 75

So, we have 5 cities:
- 1 (Paris)
- 25
- 50
- 75
- 100 (Rome)

There are 2 roads from Paris to Rome:
1 -> 50 -> 100
1 -> 50 -> 25 -> 75 -> 100
