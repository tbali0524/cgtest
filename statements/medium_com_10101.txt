A contribution by Syneil

This is the first in a series of 1010 puzzles.

You are given a grid of width {{W}} and height {{H}}. Each cell is either empty, represented as a dot "<<.>>", or filled, represented with a hash "<<#>>".

You are allowed to place a 2x2 block in the grid wherever it will fit (i.e., all of those 2x2 cells are empty).

You must find a place for your 2x2 block to completely fill as many rows and columns and report how many rows and columns you can complete.
