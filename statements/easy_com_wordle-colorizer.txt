You are given the [[answer]] to today's <<Wordle>> and a list of [[N]] [[attempt]]s to solve it.

For each [[attempt]], you must print the result (5 characters) corresponding to the 5 letters of [[attempt]] consisting of:
- {{#}} if the letter is at the right place
- {{O}} if the letter is in [[answer]] but at another place
- {{X}} for all other cases

Example:
If [[answer]] is {{POLKA}} and [[attempt]] is {{SOLAR}}, then result should be {{X##OX}}:
 - {{S}} is not in [[answer]]
 - {{O}} is at the right place
 - {{L}} is at the right place
 - {{A}} is in [[answer]] but at another place
 - {{R}} is not in [[answer]]

Additionally, if a particular letter appears in [[attempt]] and in [[answer]] a different number of times, the result should be based on the following priority:
1. {{#}} for correctly placed letters
2. {{O}} for misplaced letters which appear earlier in [[attempt]]
3. {{X}} for any excess appearances
