Goal
The goal is to predict the position of two balls after stopping (at the beginning: one is moving, the other is immobile).
- The radius of the balls is 30.75mm
- We consider there is no borders.
- Any collision is perfectly elastic.
- The formula of the acceleration induced by the frictions is: a_d(t) = -0.8*v(t)
With v(t) the speed of the ball (in meters per second) and t the time (in seconds)

Input
Line 1: Two real numbers x0 and y0 (separated by a space), the position of the moving ball (in meters).
Line 2: Two real numbers x1 and y1 (separated by a space), the position of the static ball (in meters).
Line 3: Two real numbers vx and vy (separated by a space), the components of the velocity (in meters per second).

Output
Line 1: x0_f and y0_f (separated by a space), the components of the position of the moving ball when stopped rounded to two decimals (in meters).
Line 2: x1_f and y1_f (separated by a space), the components of the position of the static ball when stopped rounded to two decimals (in meters).
