You have [[N]] cards in a stack. Each card has a different number written on it.

The top card is written 1. The second card is written 2. The third card is written 3...
The sequence continues to the last card (the bottom card) which is written [[N]].

Repeat the following operations until the stack of cards is reduced to 1 card:
➀ throw away the top card
② move the current top card to the bottom

You got one last card in hand. What is the number written on it?
