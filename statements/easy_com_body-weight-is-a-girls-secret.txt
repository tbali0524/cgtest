Five girls wanted to step on a scale to measure their weights. However, as boys were nearby watching, they did not want their individual weights to be disclosed.

They chose to pair up to go on the scale. Two girls at a time, they got 10 measurements by doing 10 different pairings.

Afterwards, a problem arose. How could the 10 measurements be converted back to 5 individual weights for each of the girls?
