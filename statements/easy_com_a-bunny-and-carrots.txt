Farmer Fibo has a nice [[M]]×[[N]] grid of carrots in his garden. However, he also owns a very hungry bunny named Bugs who really likes carrots.
In each turn, Bugs hops along one of the [[N]] columns and eats the first carrot he finds. i.e. if the [[i]]th column is chosen, he eats the carrot in ([[j]],[[i]]) where [[j]] is the highest value for which there is a carrot.

Given an array with the column choices of Bugs, for each of them print the <<perimeter>> of the region of carrots remaining after Bugs has eaten that carrot.

For example, take the following 2×2 garden where "{{C}}" stands for a carrot and "{{X}}" stands for eaten:

` _ _
|C C|
|C C|
 - -`

The perimeter is 8 as all grid is covered with carrots. 

Suppose the choices are the array [2,1,1,2].
This is how the garden will look like after each eaten carrot:
 ` _ _
|C C|
   -
|C|X
 -

 _ _
|C C|
 - -
 X X

   _
 X|C|
   -
 X X`

and finally:

` X X
 X X`

The perimeters of the area occupied by the carrots are respectively <<8, 6, 4 and 0>>.
