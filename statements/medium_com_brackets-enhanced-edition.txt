You must determine whether a given expression's bracketing can be made valid by flipping them in-place. An expression has a valid bracketing when all the parentheses {{()}}, square brackets {{[]}}, curly braces {{{} }} and angle brackets {{<>}} are correctly paired and nested.

You can flip a bracketing element in-place by replacing it with its counterpart, e.g. replace a {{(}} with a {{)}}, or a {{>}} with a {{<}}. For example, converting the second parenthesis in the expression below would make it valid: `<{[(abc(]}> → <{[(abc)]}>`
(This is a harder version of the community puzzle “Brackets, Extended Edition”. You may want to complete that one first.)
