A scientist has put you in charge of monitoring his experiment vat. You must follow their instructions and add more cells, and tell them the results when the experiment concludes.

The scientist will first tell you details about their experiment, namely [[max]], how many cells can be in the vat at any one time, and [[cycles]], how long the experiment will go for.
A cycle occurs whenever you receive input. During a cycle, all cells are doubled, after which you follow the scientists instructions.

The scientist may tell you to add a cell, in the format "[[name]] [[initialCount]] [[power]]", where [[name]] is the name of the cell, [[initialCount]] is the initial number cells being added, and [[power]] is the strength of the cell.
If the scientist tells you to put in cells that there is not enough room for, you must print {{OVERFLOW!}} and disregard all results.

The scientist might have a breakthrough during the experiment, and tell you to {{STOP!}}. This message will <<always>> come in the format {{STOP! 0 0}}, and when you receive it you should disregard all further instructions and tell the scientist the results.

When multiple cells try to grow into the same space, the conflicted territory will be split evenly (floor division) among the cells with the highest power.

When the vat is <<exactly full>>, cells with higher power will begin to take the space of cells with lower power. When this occurs, a cell will take a tenth of its desired growth from the cell with the lowest power and count that can fully support the loss.

Results should follow this format:

EMPTY: (how many empty spaces there are remaining if > 0)
Cell names: (how many cells of that type exist if > 0)

Cell counts should be outputted in the same order you added them in.
