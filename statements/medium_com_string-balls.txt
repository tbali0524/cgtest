Let's name the string {{abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}} the alphabet, and let <<d>> be the distance between two elements in the alphabet defined by the absolute value of the difference of their indexes. For example: 
`  
  d("b", "d") = d("d", "b") = 2
  d("f", "f") = 0
  d("a", "z") = 25
`
We can extend <<d>> to strings <<of equal length>> as follows: given two strings sa, sb of equal length <<len>>, d(sa, sb) is the <<sum of the pairwise d(sa[i], sb[i]) for all index values (i) from 0 to len-1>>. For example:
`
  d("fb", "fd") = d("f", "f") + d("b", "d") = 0 + 2 = 2
  d("ab", "ac") = d("ac", "ab") = 1
  d("ac", "bb") = 2
`
We can now define a (closed) ball of [[center]] a given string and of (integer) [[radius]]. A point [[p]] (i.e. a string with letters in the alphabet and of same length as the [[center]]) is inside the ball if d([[center]], [[p]]) <= [[radius]].

Find the number of points contained in the ball of center [[center]] and radius [[radius]].

<<Example (Test 4):>> 
2
ab

The points at distance less or equal to {{2}} of {{ab}} are:
- at distance 0: ab
- at distance 1: bb, aa, ac
- at distance 2: cb, ad, bc, ba

For a total of <<8>> points contained in the (closed) ball of center {{ab}} and radius {{2}}.

<<NB:>> Tests 1-7 cover simple cases and should help you debug your program. Tests 8-11 check the performance.
