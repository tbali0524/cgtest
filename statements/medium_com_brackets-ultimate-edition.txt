You must determine the minimum number of bracket-flipping operations needed to make a given expression valid. An expression has a valid bracketing when all the parentheses {{()}}, square brackets {{[]}}, curly braces {{{} }} and angle brackets {{<>}} are correctly paired and nested.

You can flip a bracketing element in-place by replacing it with its counterpart, e.g. replace a {{(}} with a {{)}}, or a {{>}} with a {{<}}. For example, flipping both parentheses around in the expression below would make it valid with a cost of {{2}}: `<{[)abc(]}> → <{[(abc)]}>`
(This is an arguably harder variant of community puzzle “Brackets, Enhanced Edition”. You may want to complete that one first.)
