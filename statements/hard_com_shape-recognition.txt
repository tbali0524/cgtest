Goal
In this puzzle, you are given a 20x20 grid showing a shape drawn on a board. The shape is rendered using the character # on a background of dots ., which can be one of the following: Circle, Square, or an equilateral Triangle. Your task is to analyze the grid and determine which of these shapes is present.

All the grids were generated by a pseudo-random algorithm. The algorithm picks one of three geometric shapes—circle, square, or triangle—and draws it with random properties:
▶ Position and Rotation: The shape is placed roughly in the middle of the board with a random orientation (for the square and triangle). Some shapes might also be slightly cut off at the edge by a small portion, but the shape remains easily recognisable.
▶ Size Variability: The dimensions of the shape vary within certain ranges.
▶ Noise: After the shape is drawn, a small amount of noise is added. This means that a few extra empty cells will be filled with #, making the shape slightly imperfect.

The challenge is to recognise the underlying shape despite the noise and random transformations.

Input
20 lines: Each line contains a string of 39 characters, consisting of 20 space separated #s or .s.

Output
Line 1: A single word: Circle, Square, or Triangle, representing the detected shape.

Constraints
The shape is placed approximately at the center of the grid, but not always in the same position.
Squares and triangles have a random rotation.
All triangles are equilateral.
The shape's size varies within a predefined range.
The shape is easily recognisable by the human eye, ensuring no ambiguity.
A small amount of noise is added to the grid, altering a few cells.
Some shapes might be slightly cut off at the edge by a small portion, but the shape remains easily recognisable.
