In this challenge, you are given [[N]] servers. Each server has a current load [[Li]] jobs running on it. Then a batch [[k]] jobs comes and must be distributed on the [[N]] servers. Your job is to design a program that will distribute the incoming [[k]] jobs on the servers such that the difference of the number of jobs in the server with the highest load and the one with the lowest load is minimal. Letâ€™s call this metric Minimal Imbalance.
For example if we have [[N]]={{4}} and the initial loads as follows [5,0,2,1]. For [[k]]=3 arriving jobs, distributing the jobs to get the following [5,2,2,2] achieves the Minimal Imbalance. The result here is 3 (5-2)
This challenge was one of the problems in Amazon Last Mile 22.
