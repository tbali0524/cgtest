Jack Silver is a spy from the international spy agency. 

In his current mission he observes his targets at a roulette table at the Great Grand Casino in Villan City. He needs to know how much money his targets have at the end of the game.

The target plays as follows:
- He always bets 1/4 of the cash he currently has. If it is a fractional value, he always rounds up.
- The target's calls, [[CALL]], can be  one of the three possibilities:
-- {{EVEN}} - He bets on an EVEN (non-zero) number
-- {{ODD}} - He bets on an ODD number
-- {{PLAIN}} - He bets on a specific number: [[NUMBER]]

<<NOTE:>> Since the odds of winning are much lower for {{PLAIN}} bets, the payout for a win is higher: {{35 to 1}}. For {{EVEN}} and {{ODD}}, the payout is {{1 to 1}}. As an example, if the ball comes up as 23, and the target bets 100, the payouts would be as follows:

 - If he called {{EVEN}}, then he would lose his 100 bet.
 - If he called {{ODD}}, then he would get his 100 bet back, plus an extra 100.
 - If he called {{PLAIN}} and specified any number other than 23, he would lose his 100 bet.
 - If he called {{PLAIN}} and specified 23 as his number, he would get back his 100 bet plus an extra 3500.
