This was a puzzle invented and solved by Chinese during the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, with innovative solution steps recorded in Mathematical treaties of that era. Translated the text into modern terminologies:

<<Let x be an integer. Divide x by 3, remains 2; divide x by 5, remains 3; divide x by 7, remains 2. Find the minimum value of x.>>

You are going to solve similar puzzles with the aid of state-of-the-art technologies and know-how. Take the challenge?


Beware, the moduli you are given may not be pairwise coprime. Moreover, your answer must always be as small as possible while being <<greater than or equal to>> every modulo in input. For instance, if you are asked for an integer x such that:
- it remains 3 when dividing x by 8
- it remains 11 when dividing x by 15
- it remains 1 when dividing x by 10,
then the answer is 131. In this example, 11 is not a valid answer since it is less than 15 (the modulo in the second constraint).
