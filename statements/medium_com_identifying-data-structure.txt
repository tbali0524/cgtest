There is a mysterious data structure. This structure is like a bag which allows putting data in and taking data out. But it is a magic bag that sometimes behaves in ways you can hardly imagine. You have to guess, as far as possible, what structure it is by looking at its behaviors.

To keep it simple, we limit our analysis to only three known data structures:
<<Queue>> (First In First Out)
<<Stack>> (First In Last Out)
<<Priority Queue>> (Bigger data come out first)

We use only two operators to try out the structure:
<<i>> - input data, similar to [add, put, push, insert, ...], for adding an element to structure.
<<o>> - output data, similar to [pop, poll, pull, delete, ...], which will remove one element from the structure for output.

The data are simple integers.

At the beginning, the data structure is empty. A sequence of <<i/o>> operations is then done on the structure. Analyze the result then tell what data structure it is.
