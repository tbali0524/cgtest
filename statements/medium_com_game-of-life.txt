According to the Wikipedia's article: "The <<Game of Life>>, also known simply as <<Life>>, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state <<live>> {{'1'}} or <<dead>> {{'0'}}. Each cell interacts with its <<eight neighbors>> (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

    1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
    2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
    3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
    4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Write a program to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.
