Take a data representation of an image and blur it by averaging each pixel's color with its neighbors above, below, and to the left and right of it.

<<Rules:>>

The average value should be the <<arithmetic mean>>, that is, all the values you are combining, divided by the number of values.

If the outcome of an average operation is not an integer, <<round it down>>.

Each pixel should be blurred using five pixels: itself, and its four neighbors (above, below, left, and right). The exception is edge and corner pixels, which will use themselves and their three/two neighbors respectively. In the diagram below, {{X}} represents a target pixel, and the {{N}}'s represent the other pixels that it should be blended with. The {{O}}'s represent pixels that should not be included.

Standard example:
`ONO
NXN
ONO`
Corner example:
`XN
NO`
Edge example:
`NO
XN
NO`
