Goal
Given a function expressed exclusively using function compositions and function sums, rewrite it by replacing the composition operator . with the reverse composition operator |>.
The reverse function composition operator behaves, unsurprisingly, by reversing the order of function application, that is:
(f |> g)(x) = g(f(x))

Examples:
f . g         --   g |> f
f + g         --   f + g
f . g + h     --   g |> f + h
(f + h) . g   --   g |> (f + h)
f . (g + h)   --   (g + h) |> f
g + f . h     --   g + h |> f

Notes:
(1) Function names are only one lowercase English letter.
(2) The + and . operators are given between spaces for easier visualization.
(3) As shown in the examples, parentheses are relevant.
(4) The expressions are well formed. They don't contain unnecessary parentheses like f . (( g + h )) or consecutive + signs etc.
(5) For debugging, notice how the transformation from . to |> is symmetric, and that the same logic, from |> to . should give back the original expression.

Input
Line 1: A string function representing a function expressed exclusively using function compositions and function sums.

Output
One line containing the original function rewritten with the |> operator.

Constraints
Function names are only one lowercase English letter.
0 < length function < 256

Example

Input
f . g

Output
g |> f
