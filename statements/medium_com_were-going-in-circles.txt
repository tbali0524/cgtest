A contribution by BartholomewIII

There is a [[w]] by [[h]] grid of arrows represented by: "{{^}}", "{{>}}", "{{v}}", "{{<}}". Empty cells are represented by periods: "{{.}}".

A <<loop of arrows>> is a set of arrows that loop back on themselves when moving from one arrow to the <<closest>> arrow in the direction that it points. If an arrow points outside the grid, it is not part of a loop.

The goal is to count the [[number_of_loops]] in the grid.
