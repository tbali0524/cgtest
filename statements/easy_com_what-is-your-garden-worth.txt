Goal
You have planted an emoji garden, but it has some empty spots and some ASCII-weeds growing in it too.

The local buying co-op has published its offeringStatement which shows the emojis it will buy this season, and how much it is offering for each (dollarAmount) .
(It likely won't buy every type of emoji and of course it doesn't buy weeds or empty space.)

Calculate the worth of your garden.

NOTE: garden is not necessarily a perfect rectangle.

Input

Line 1: An integer numOfLinesOfOfferingStatement, which is the number of lines of offeringStatement
Next numOfLinesOfOfferingStatement: A string consisting of $dollarAmount (an integer), followed by = (with a space on either side), followed by each emoji that is worth that dollarAmount. (There is no space between emojis.)
Next Line: An integer, gardenHeight, representing the number of rows that are the garden
Next gardenHeight Lines: the garden

Output
Line 1: An integer, the worth of your garden. Include $ and include a comma (,) as needed for "thousands separator"

Constraints
Emojis are characters from the UTF-8 character set

Example

Input

$12 = 🍓🥒🌿🌹
$10 = 🍃🍍
