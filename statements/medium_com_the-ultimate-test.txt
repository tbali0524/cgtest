Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the digits of a number N such that the result is K(a number). 

For an example N = 123456789 and K = 100

Explanation : 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 + 9 = 100.
(This is just 1 case you are supposed to find all of them).

NOTE  :  When there is nothing between the numbers they get appended.
NOTE  :  The order of the digits should not be changed.
NOTE  :  Ordering priority is nothing > + > - .
NOTE :   There is no 0 involved in N.
