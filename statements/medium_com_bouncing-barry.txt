Barry the bouncing bunny is a bit braindead. Barry mindlessly jumps around on an infinitely large square grid, comprising tiles that initially display the {{.}} character. Each time Barry <<lands>> on a tile, the tile toggles between displaying {{.}} and {{#}}.

Barry's bouncing behavior is described with a space-separated sequence of directions [[d_1 d_2 d_3...]] followed by an index-matched integer sequence for bounce count [[b_1 b_2 b_3...]] Directions are any of the four cardinal directions {{NSEW}}. Bounce count describes how many tiles Barry bounces forward in a straight line. <<Turning does not count as a bounce.>>

After Barry has finished his bouncing business, print the appearance of the floor, cropped to the smallest rectangle that includes all {{#}}'s.

For example, the input
`{{E S E}}
{{4 3 1}}`
would produce the floor as shown:
`{{........}}
{{..####..}}
{{.....#..}}
{{.....#..}}
{{.....##.}}
{{........}}`
but this should be printed instead:
`{{####.}}
{{...#.}}
{{...#.}}
{{...##}}`
If no tiles show {{#}} at the end of Barry's bouncing, simply print {{.}} instead.
