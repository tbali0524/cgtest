A contribution by Niako

The <<knight>> is a chess piece that, when placed on the <<o>>-marked square, can move to any of the <<x>>-marked squares (as long as they are inside the board):```.x.x.
x...x
..o..
x...x
.x.x.```
Eight knights, numbered from {{1}} to {{8}}, have been placed on a {{3}}Ã—{{3}} board, leaving one single square empty ({{.}}).
They can neither attack each other, nor share the same square, nor leave the board: the only valid moves are <<jumps to the empty square>>.

Compute the <<minimum number of valid moves>> required to reach the following ordered configuration by any sequence of valid moves:```123
456
78.```Output {{-1}} if it is not reachable.

<<Example detailed:>> Possible in 3 moves```128       12.       123       123
356  -->  356  -->  .56  -->  456
7.4       784       784       78.```
