We are looking at a system of inequalities. Here all inequalities are simple and consist of one variable on each side. Considering a system of strict inequalities, determine whether this system is inherently consistent or if there is a flaw. A flaw is a contradiction of two or more inequalities, e.g. A > B > C > A. This is not possible from a logical point of view.
