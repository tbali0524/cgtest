Moles have infested a 16x16 area. 
The fences  of your gardens are outlined on maps with {{|}}, {{+}} and {{-}} symbols.
The mole hills are represented by a lower-case {{o}}.
How many mole hills are in your gardens?

- Two parallel fences of the garden cannot touch (it wouldn't make sense).
- Garden space is filled with white space unless there is a mole hill. Other space is filled with dots unless there is a mole hill.
- Everything that touches the outside of the map and is not enclosed in fences is other space. A fence is always between garden space and other space.
- Mole hills cannot be on fences.
