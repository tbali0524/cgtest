Goal
It is a well known result that a map, split into different regions (countries, states, ...) can be painted using different colors on contiguous regions with at most 4 different colors (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem), although the proof isn't really obvious...

But in how many ways can it be painted?

You are given a "map", simplified to N neighborhood relationships (regionA regionB, space separated).

You are also given a list of integers, corresponding to available colors.
The goal is, for each integer C in the list, to compute in how many ways the map can be painted using at most C colors.


Example: Consider a map with 4 regions in a square
A-B
| |
D-C

One definition can be (N = 4)
A B
A D
C B
C D

Given 1 single color, there is no way to paint it.
Using 2 colors, there are 2 ways: A = C = first color and B = D = second color; or the opposite.
Given 5 different colors, there are
* 5 possible colors for A
* 4 possible colors for B
* considering B and D are the same, there is one possibility for D, and then 4 possible colors for C (not B = not D)
* considering B and D aren't the same, there are 3 possible colors for D, and then 3 possible colors for C (not B and not D)
Total = 5 × 4 × (1×4 + 3×3) = 260 ways to paint the map.

So, for such map and an entry 1 2 5, answer will be:
0
2
260

Input
First line: N, number of neighborhood relationships
Next N lines: 2 neighbor entity names, space separated
Next line: K, number of color sets
Next K lines: an integer C, number of colors available

Output
K lines: Painting configuration counts for this map using C colors for each value of C

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 25
1 ≤ K ≤ 10
1 ≤ C ≤ 1000

Note: For the given test cases, all results are < 2^32.
