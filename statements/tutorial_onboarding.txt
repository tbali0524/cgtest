Your program must destroy the enemy ships by shooting the closest enemy on each turn.

Rules

enemy1 and dist1: the name and the distance to enemy 1.
enemy2 and dist2: the name and the distance to enemy 2.
Before your turn is over (end of the loop), output the value of either enemy1 or enemy2 to shoot the closest enemy.
