A contribution by JBM

The program must output the result of tumbling a landscape a certain number of times.

Tumbling entails:
- rotating the landscape counterclockwise by 90°
- letting the hash bits {{#}} fall down

The map is composed of {{.}} and {{#}}.

(This puzzle is a twist (hah!) on classic community puzzle “Gravity”. You may want to solve that one first.)
