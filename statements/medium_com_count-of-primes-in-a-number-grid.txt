Given a grid of single digit numbers in [[R]] rows and [[C]] columns, count the number of <<distinct>> primes that can be found using <<Across>> or <<Down>> reading order. Partial use of the numbers in any direction is allowed, but skipping digits is not.

Example:  In the grid below:
2 3
1 7

The primes that can found are : <<2, 3, 7, 17, 23, 37>>.  So, the output would be {{6}}.  Note that 13 and 71 are not counted as they  are not a result of using the across or down reading order.
