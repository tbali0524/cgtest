"We don't make mistakes, just happy little accidents." - Bob Ross

While creating mountains in ASCII, you realized that taller mountains could start off from the smaller ones,  so why not make some more mountains?



<<Rules:>>

- You will be given a list of the heights of mountain peaks along a row.

- The starting height is considered as 0. 

- Each step of rise in altitude is represented by '/' and fall by '\'.

- Each peak consists of a rise and fall '/\' at the appropriate height.

- Once a peak has been drawn, proceed either up or down to the next peak. Do not return to 0 between peaks.  

- After generating the mountains, end at height 0.

- You may need to draw below 0. Remember, mountains are made from a step lower than their peak. Example, for [[-1]] :
`\    /   
 \/\/` which demonstrates the tip of the mountain at -1 height, given that the starting and ending point are at height 0.
