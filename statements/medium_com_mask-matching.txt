Goal
You are given a positive integer called mask in hexadecimal notation, which is less than 2^28. Your task is to find up to 15 integers that match the condition:
(mask & n) == n
where n is a positive integer. These integers are called mask-matching integers.
Output the mask-matching integers in decimal form, starting from the smallest. If there are more than 15 integers that match, output the first 13 smallest numbers, followed by ,..., and the last 2 largest numbers.

Input
Line 1: A single positive integer mask in hexadecimal notation

Output
Line 1: A comma-separated list of up to 15 mask-matching integers in decimal.

Constraints
1 ≤ mask ≤ 0x3FFF_FFFF_FFFF_FFFF (i.e. 2^62 - 1)

Example

Input

Output
2,4,6,8,10,12,14
