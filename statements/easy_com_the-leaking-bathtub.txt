Bob has a bathtub.
He wants to fill it with water but there are some leaks that let the water flow.
Given the dimensions [[S]] and [[h]] of the bathtub, the tap water [[flow]] and the [[leakHeight]] and [[leakFlow]] of each leak, calculate the [[time]], rounded to the second down, Bob needs to fill his bathtub.
A leak does not leak the water flow until the water has reached the leak height.
The bathtub is a rectangular parallelepiped of surface area [[S]] and height [[h]].
