Goal
We define the beautiful value of an integer sequence as the product of the value of its smallest element and its length. You are given an integer sequence containing N elements, and you should find out one of its continuous subsequences, such that it has the largest beautiful value among all the continuous subsequences.

Please solve this problem with an O(N) algorithm.

Input
Line 1: A single integer N, indicating the length of the sequence.
Line 2: N integers indicating the sequence.

Output
Line 1: The largest beautiful value you can find. (Note you don't need to output the subsequence itself.)

Constraints
1<=N<=100000
The value of the elements is between 0 and 10000, inclusive.

Example

Input
3
1 2 3

Output
4
