Goal
The gaming company Intergalactical Gaming Corporation is about to launch a new game based on logic gates called Xorandor. The purpose of the game is to light up a LED by powering (or not) inputs and flipping (or not) switches to have the current flow thru various logic gates until all inputs of the LED are powered. This of course has to be done in a minimum steps. Each step is either powering/depowering an input or flipping a switch.
Before going to retail, the CEO insists on having the game checked, especially the minimum steps required for each level.
Your task is to determine and list for each proposed level the minimum steps to be performed to light the LED. In case several solutions exist, you must list the solution that would come first in top-left bottom-right order.

Of courses there are conventions to respect:
- Inputs are named I1, I2 ... In, where I1 correspond to the leftmost input and In to the rightmost one.
- Switches are named K1, K2 ... Kn, in order of their appearance from top to bottom, left to right.

You are provided a representation of each level using the Crappy Magnificent Original Standard©®™ (CMOS) format. In this format :
- the height and width of the electronic circuit
- the LED to light is on the first line of the file;
- the INPUTs are at the last useful line of the file;
- each component (gate, LED, switch) is represented by a special character surrounded by []. There maybe some spaces surrounding the special character;
- inputs are represented by either a 0 (for unpowered input) or a 1 for powered input and have only an output pin and no input pins;
- the LED only has a variable number of input pins and no output pins;
- the logic gates have only 1 output, which is always aligned with its special character;
- the NOT gate has only 1 input, the other gates have 2 inputs;
- the switches have only 1 input and 2 outputs. Depending on their status they either let the current pass to the right or to the left;
- wires link each input and outputs;
- wires can fork to link 1 output pin to several input pins;
- wires do not overlap each other nor do they go thru/above/under a gate;
- current always flows from bottom to top (ie from inputs toward the LED);
- input and output pins are always represented as a | and are always attached to their component.


9 11 <-- The height and width of the layout 
    [@] <-- The LED you want to light ! 
     |
   [ & ]  <-- AND gate
    | |
  +-+ +-+  <-- wires linking the OR gates to the AND gate
  |     |
[ | ] [ | ]  <-- 2 OR GATES * 
 | |   | |
 0 0   0 0   <-- INPUTS (all set to 0) names from left to right I1, I2, I3 and I4

* do not mistake the | for the OR gate with a wire. Gates are surrounded by [ ]. This also applies for the XOR gate ( + ) and the NOR gate ( - ).

Input
Line 1 : height width height and width of the the layout of the eletronic circuit space separated
next height lines : the layout of the eletronic circuit line by line

special characters used to identified the components between [] :
- @ : LED
- ~ : NOT
- & : AND
- | : OR
- + : XOR
- ^ : NAND
- - : NOR
- = : XNOR
- < : switch forwarding to its left output pin
- > : switch forwarding to its right output pin

Wires are drawn using the following characters : -|+

Output
You must output the minimum steps (ie which switch/input to be toggled from original setting) to be performed from top-left to bottom-right. Each step must be on a line.
Constraints
0 <= height < 128
0 <= width < 128
0 <= number of switches <= 9
1 <= number of inputs <= 9
