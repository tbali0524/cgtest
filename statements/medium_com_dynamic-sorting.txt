Sorting in a webApi should be tricky as you have to pass all your parameters in a single URL in a GET request, your team decided to do use this convention to order the result by prop1 ascending, <<then>> by prop2 descending, <<then>> by prop3 ascending.
<<+prop1-prop2+prop3>>

You have to read the given items and print their Ids ordered by the given sorting expression.
