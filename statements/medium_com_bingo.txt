Provided with a set of <<bingo cards>>, and the order in which the numbers will be called, output how many numbers need to be called before somebody has a <<line>>, followed by how many numbers need to be called before somebody has "bingo" (all numbers on their sheet filled in).

A <<bingo card>> is defined as a [[5x5]] set of numbers between 1 and 90. The center of a bingo card is a "free space", meaning it is already filled in - this is denoted with a [[0]] in this puzzle. 

A <<line>> on the bingo card is defined as any row, column or diagonal of 5 numbers on the card.
