A number [[N]] is displayed on the calculator. 

First player picks a digit d between 1 and 9.
[[N]] is replaced by [[N]] - d.
Second player does the same thing, but has to choose a key which is adjacent to the last one (but not the same one, you cannot repeat the digit select by the opponent).
Repeat until one player gets a negative number. He lost !

For example, we start with [[N]] =  20.

`7  8  9` 
`4  5  6` 
`1  2  3` 
First player can pick any digit and hits 8.
[[N]] becomes 12.

`7  x  9` 
`4  5  6` 
`*  *  *` 
Second player can pick 4, 5, 6, 7 or 9. He picks 9
[[N]] becomes 3.

`*  8  x` 
`*  5  6` 
`*  *  *` 
First player can pick 5, 6 or 8. He picks 5.
[[N]] becomes -2.
First player has lost this game.

Your job is to find all winning moves in a starting situation.

Examples:
- if [[N]] = 1, then 1 is the only winning move (getting to 0 makes the other player lose since he will have to make [[N]] negative on his turn).
- if [[N]] = 8, then 5 is NOT a winning move (since second player can reply with 3).

Note: detailed specification of what is "near".

When 1 was selected, then 2, 4 or 5 can be selected.
When 2 was selected, then 1, 3, 4, 5 or 6 can be selected.
When 3 was selected, then 2, 5 or 6 can be selected.
When 4 was selected, then 1, 2, 5, 7, or 8 can be selected.
When 5 was selected, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 or 9 can be selected.
When 6 was selected, then 2, 3, 5, 8 or 9 can be selected.
When 7 was selected, then 4, 5 or 8 can be selected.
When 8 was selected, then 4, 5, 6, 7 or 9 can be selected.
When 9 was selected, then 5, 6, or 8 can be selected.
