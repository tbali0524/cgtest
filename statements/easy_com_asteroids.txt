You have been tasked with studying a region of space to detect potentially dangerous asteroids.
You are given two pictures of the night sky of dimensions {{W}}*{{H}}, taken at two different times {{t1}} and {{t2}}.
For your convenience, asteroids have been marked with capital letters {{A}} to {{Z}}, the rest is empty space represented by a <<dot>> (<<{{.}}>>) .
Using the information contained in those two pictures, determine the position of the asteroids at {{t3}}, and output a picture <<of the same region of the sky>>.

If necessary, the final coordinates are to <<be rounded-down>> (floor).
Asteroids travel at different altitudes (with {{A}} being the closest and {{Z}} the farthest from your observation point) and therefore cannot collide with each other during their transit.
If two or more asteroids have the same final coordinates, output <<only the closest one>>.
It is guaranteed that all asteroids at {{t1}} will still be present at {{t2}}, that <<no asteroids are hidden>> in the given pictures, and that there is only <<one asteroid per altitude>>.

<<NB:>> Because of the flooring operation, it is important that you choose a coordinate system with the origin at the top left corner and the y axis increasing in the downward direction.
