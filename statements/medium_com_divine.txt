A contribution by Bob

In a typical match-3 game, the goal is to create alignments of 3 or more identical tokens by swapping two adjacent tokens.

Your program must implement a hint system for a match-3 game by listing all pairs of tokens that could be swapped to generate horizontal or vertical alignements of 3 or more tokens within a 2D grid of 9 rows by 9 columns.

The pairs must be given ordered by row, then colum, i.e. from top left to bottom right.
A given pair must be given only once, i.e. if you report (A,B) you must not report (B,A) as well.
For instance, if the token at row 5 and column 7 can be swapped with each of its four neighbors, then the expected report is
4 7 5 7
5 6 5 7
5 7 5 8
5 7 6 7
