A contribution by seb

<<Awalé>> is an african 2 players game consisting of moving grains in some bowls. Each player has 7 bowls indexed from 0 to 6. The last bowl is the reserve.

At each turn a player chooses one of his own bowls except the reserve, picks up all grains there and redistributes them one by one to bowls beginning just after the chosen one. If the number of grains in hand is sufficient, after adding one to his reserve the player continues the distribution in the opponent's bowls excluding his reserve and then back in his own bowls, until his hand is empty.

If the final grain is distributed to the player's reserve, he is allowed to play again.

<<Examples>>

`bowls num : 0 1 2 3 4 5  6
--------------------------
opp bowls : 5 1 0 6 2 2 [3]
 my bowls : 3 4 0 3 3 2 [2]`

I play bowl 0: distribute 3 grains in bowl 1, 2 and 3
`bowls num : 0 1 2 3 4 5  6
--------------------------
opp bowls : 5 1 0 6 2 2 [3]
 my bowls : 0 5 1 4 3 2 [2]`

I play bowl 5: distribute 2 grains (1 in my reserve and 1 in the first opponent bowl)
`bowls num : 0 1 2 3 4 5  6
--------------------------
opp bowls : 6 1 0 6 2 2 [3]
 my bowls : 3 4 0 3 3 0 [3]`

If I end in my reserve I can replay:
I play bowl 3:
`bowls num : 0 1 2 3 4 5  6
--------------------------
opp bowls : 5 1 0 6 2 2 [3]
 my bowls : 3 4 0 0 4 3 [3]
REPLAY`

Your goal is to simulate your turn of game. Given the numbers of grains in each bowl and the [[num]] of the chosen bowl your program has to display the new situation and the string {{REPLAY}} if the player has a chance to play again. Print the numbers of grains of opponent bowls separated by space, then yours. Put reserve counts between brackets.

Remember that the player always skips the opponent's reserve when distributing!
