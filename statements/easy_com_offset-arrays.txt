A contribution by Andriamanitra

To settle the debate of 0-based vs 1-based indexing I have created a language where you must explicitly state the range of indices an array should have. 

For example, given an array definition "A[-1..1] = 1 2 3", you would have:
A[-1] = 1
A[0] = 2
A[1] = 3

You are given a list of [[n]] array definitions and your job is to figure out what number is found in a given index [[i]] of an array [[arr]]. Note that the indexing operations may be nested (in the above example, A[A[-1]] would produce result 3).
