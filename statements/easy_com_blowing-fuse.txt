You are going to write a program to predict whether a specific usage pattern of electrical appliances will cause the main fuse to blow.

You have three pieces of data.
1. There are [[n]] appliances in a room, each of them has an electrical current consumption value.
2. A usage pattern. You will click the power buttons of a list of appliances in a sequence, at most [[m]] clicks. Each click on a button will toggle the power status, which means when the power is OFF, a click will turn it ON. Clicking it again will turn it OFF.
3. The capacity of the main fuse [[c]] in amperes [A].

The fuse will be blown if the sum of the consumed current of turned-on devices at some point exceeds the capacity of the main fuse [[c]].

At the beginning, all appliances are OFF.
