<<Balanced ternary>>(3 base) is a non-standard positional numeral system. In the standard (unbalanced) ternary system, digits have values 0, 1 and 2. The digits in the <<balanced ternary>> system have values âˆ’1, 0, and 1. We use letter {{T}} to represent -1, so the digits are {{(T, 0, 1)}}.

E.g.: [[1T0]] = 1 * (3**2)  + (-1)*(3**1) + 0*(3**0) = 9 - 3 + 0 = 6

You must convert input integer (decimal)  number to its balanced ternary representation.
