A robot starts at cell (0, 0) on a grid with [[R]] rows and [[C]] columns.
The robot is able to move one cell at a time.  It can only move 
left, right, up or down (no diagonals).  Every cell in the grid has
a value. The value of each cell is the sum of the digits of the row index
plus the sum of the digits in the column index.  Note, it's the sum of 
the digits of these indices, not the index values.   Eg, cell (3,4) has 
value 7 and cell (11, 35) has value 10 (1+1+3+5).  

The robot has a threshold [[T]].  It can only visit cells whose value less 
or equal to this threshold.   Eg, if the robot's threshold is 6, it cannot 
visit (3,4) whose value is 7.

Here's a sample table with [[R]]=5, [[C]]=5 and [[T]]= 2
`
   | 0  1  2  3  4
 ------------------   
 0 | 0  1  2  3  4
 1 | 1  2  3  4  5
 2 | 2  3  4  5  6
 3 | 3  4  5  6  7
 4 | 4  5  6  7  8
 `
In the sample above the robot can visit exactly 6 cells, all the ones where 
the cell value is <= 2.

Given [[R]]=50, [[C]]=50, [[T]]=18,  cell (35, 37) has row/col digit sum of 3+5+3+7=18.  
If the robot could get to (35,37)  it could land on that cell since 18 is less or 
equal to the threshold 18.  However, it cannot land on cell (35, 38) because 
3+5+3+8=19 and that is greater than the threshold.

Your job is to compute how many cells can the robot reach if it starts at (0,0),
can move up, down, left or right 1 cell at a time and wants to visit as much of 
the grid as possible.

Hint: consider this part of the grid

 12 |  4   5   6   7   8
 13 |  5   6   7   8   9
 14 |  6   7   8   9  10
