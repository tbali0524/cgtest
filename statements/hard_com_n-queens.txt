Goal
We have to place n queens on a chessboard made of n x n squares.
We need to place all of them in such a way that none of them is in direct contact nor attacking another one.
(meaning only one queen is occupying each line, column and diagonal)

Example with n = 4, s = 2 solutions :

- Q - -
- - - Q
Q - - -
- - Q -

and

- - Q -
Q - - -
- - - Q
- Q - -

Input
n : Number of queens (height and width of the cheessboard).

Output
s : Number of solutions.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 11

Example

Input
4

Output
2
