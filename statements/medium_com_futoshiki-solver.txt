Futoshiki is a Japanese numeric logic puzzle similar to the more popular Sudoku.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki
Like in Sudoku, in a Futoshiki of size n every row and every column must contain every number from 1 to n.
Unlike Sudoku there may be greater than / less than relations between cells.

For a n×n Futoshiki the input will be 2n-1 lines of digits {{0..n}} ({{0}} meaning empty), and either spaces or inequality constraints {{^}} {{v}} {{<}} {{>}} separating the digits of length 2n-1.

{{^}} meaning the cell below the symbol has a higher value than the one above the symbol and so on.


<<Example:>> A 2×2 Futoshiki
```0>0
v ^
0<0```having the solution:
```21
12```
