We have a snail race we will have to determine the winner !
- The number of snails is given in the variable [[numberSnails]].
- Each snail has a speed given in the variable [[speedSnail]]
- You have a map of the game with a height of [[mapHeight]] and a width of [[mapWidth]].

On the map we have:
{{number}} that represents a snail from 1 to [[numberSnails]]
{{*}} which represents a place where the snail can go
{{#}} which represents the destination

`Snails can go right, left, up, down. Snails cannot go diagonally.
The snail takes the path closest to it.`

example of the game :

snail {{1}} speed {{2}}
snail {{2}} speed {{1}}

start :

1****#
2****#

time = 1

**1**#
*2***#

time = 2

****1#
**2**#

time=3

*****1
***2*#

End : 

return {{1}}

For each race there is only one winner.
