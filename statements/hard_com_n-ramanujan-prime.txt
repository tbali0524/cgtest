Goal
The nᵀᴴ Ramanujan prime is the smallest positive integer Rₙ such that there are at least n prime numbers in the range (x/2, x] for all x ≥ Rₙ.

The first few Ramanujan primes are:
2, 11, 17, 29, 41, 47, 59, 67, 71, 97, ...

Your task is to find Rₙ for a given n.

It is known that, for all n ≥ 1, Rₙ must lie within the range:
2n⋅ln(2n) < Rₙ < 4n⋅ln(4n)

Input
A single positive integer n.

Output
A single positive integer Rₙ.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁵

Example

Input
3

Output
17
