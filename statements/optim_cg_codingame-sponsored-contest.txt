STATEMENT
Solve this puzzle, show your best coding skills and grab the chance to join our tech team!

This is a reverse engineering challenge. We made a really cool puzzle, but we aren't telling you anything, you have to figure out what it's about for yourself, and then optimize your program to get the best possible score!

To beat a CodinGamer you have to think like a real CodinGamer :)

The Goal
At CodinGame we love inventing new games but developing a game requires a lot of work. We need to agree on the rules, implement a referee to determine whether a solution is correct or not, develop the graphics engine and finally test the game itself. In order to keep improving CodinGame we need to increase the size of our team.

This time, we won't do the graphical part. We won't even bother telling you what the inputs are. It's up to you to understand what you need to do in order to achieve the best possible score.

We will also participate in this challenge, do you think you can beat us?
