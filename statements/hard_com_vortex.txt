Goal
You must crank an WxH matrix counterclockwise by X positions. To crank a matrix, you must shift each matrix element along the matrix rectangle. For example, for a 7x5 matrix with X = 1 the movements are performed this way:

v < < < < < <
v v < < < < ^
v v 0 0 0 ^ ^
v > > > > ^ ^
> > > > > > ^

where the characters < ^ > v represent the displacement of a value in that position; 0 means no displacement.

Input
Line 1: 2 integers W and H representing the width and height (respectively) of a matrix.
Line 2: An integer X representing the number of positions to crank the matrix.
Next H lines: W matrix values v per line.

Output
H lines: The cranked matrix.

Constraints
1 ≤ W,H ≤ 50
1 ≤ X ≤ 100000000
-100 ≤ v ≤ 100
