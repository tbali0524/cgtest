Your goal is to recreate the behaviour of the UNIX tree program with support for some flags.
You'll be given a starting path [[S]], a list of flags [[F]], and a list of files.

The tree will be printed with characters pipe {{|}} backtick {{`}} hyphen {{-}} and with spaces.
Refer to the first example to understand how you need to print the tree.

You'll also need to handle three flags inspired by the original tree program:
- {{-a}} : Display hidden directories and files.
- {{-d}}: Only display directories (modifies the report line, see below).
- {{-L}} [[depth]]: Limit the "depth" of the tree.

A hidden file or directory has a name starting with a dot: {{.}}

The input path [[S]] must be printed followed by the text {{[error opening dir]}} <<if>>:
- the path is a file, or
- the path doesn't exist

Finally, you'll need to print a new line plus the number of directories and files found as follows:

{{[[x]] directories, [[y]] files}}

where [[x]] is the number of directories and [[y]] is the number of files. If the {{-d}} option is in effect, that last line reads like this instead:

{{[[x]] directories}}

If [[x]] or [[y]] are equal to {{1}}, then you need to print {{directory}} and {{file}} respectively.

The tree needs to be sorted in <<ascending, alphabetical, case insensitive order>> and <<without considering>> the leading and first character '.' (dot) from hidden files or directories names.

Incorrect flags must be ignored.
You're only given valid paths, which are only starting with <<one "current directory" (./)>> and <<without "parent directory" (../)>>
There are no empty directories.
There are no spaces in files or directory names.
There are no duplicated directories or files with the same name as either a hidden or non-hidden file/directory <<on the same depth>> (i.e: you will never see both <<.Directory1>> and <<Directory1>> in the same folder)
