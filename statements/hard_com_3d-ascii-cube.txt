Goal
Draw a text representation of a 3D cube from a list of numbers.

Each cell must be 1 line high and 3 characters wide, excluding any connectors.
Lines parallel to the X axis are represented by underscore: _ characters.
Lines parallel to the Y axis are represented by forward slash: / characters.
Lines parallel to the Z axis are represented by vertical bar: | characters.

Formatting rules:
The integer should be centered if possible, or aligned to the left if not.
If the integer overlaps anything, the integer should be shown.

Input
Line 1: The number N of integers going to be input.
Next N lines: An Integer I which goes in the cube.

Output
Multiple lines with each line displaying a new row of the cube.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 64
-99 ≤ I ≤ 999
