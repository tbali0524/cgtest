A contribution by Bob

Given a rugby score, your program must compute the different scoring combinations that lead to that particular score.
As a reminder:
 - a try is worth 5 points
 - after a try, a transformation kick is played and is worth 2 extra points if successful
 - penalty kicks and drops are worth 3 points
