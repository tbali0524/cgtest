For every fraction in the form 1/[[n]] (where n is an integer > 0), we can always find two positive integers [[x]] and [[y]] such that:

<<1/n = 1/x + 1/y>>

There can be one or more pairs of [[x]] and [[y]] fitting the above equation.


<<Example>>
Given n = 2
1/2 = 1/6 + 1/3
1/2 = 1/4 + 1/4


Could you list out all these equations for a given n?
