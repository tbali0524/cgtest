A contribution by WIlChrist

Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states that every even natural number greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.

For each given even integer [[m]], find all distinct prime couples summing to [[m]], and print their count.

<<Example explanation:>> 38 get these 2 possible sums
38 = 7 + 31
38 = 19 + 19
