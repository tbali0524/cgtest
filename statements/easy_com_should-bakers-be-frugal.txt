<<Background/terms:>>
• A biscuit is round (a circle)
• Measurements are in inches (not necessarily full inches)
• When a Baker has a flattened-out square of dough ("DoughSquare"), he will cut-out biscuits (in grid-style orderly columns and rows) until no more biscuits can be cut-out

<<The difference:>>
There are two types of Bakers: "Wasteful" and "Frugal":
• A Wasteful Baker will stop there, and throw away the remaining dough ☹️
• A Frugal Baker will take the remaining dough and re-form it into another (smaller) DoughSquare, and repeat the cutting process.  He will continue to do this until no full-biscuit can be cut-out.

NOTE: At the end, there might be enough dough left to manually shape into a circle of the required diameter, but the Baker is <<not>> allowed to do this.  In order to make a biscuit, the DoughSquare itself must be big enough so that the Baker can place the biscuit cutter fully on it.

<<The question:>>
Given the length of a [[side]] of the starting DoughSquare, and the [[diameter]] of the biscuit cutter, how many <<more>> biscuits can a Frugal Baker cut-out than a Wasteful Baker?
