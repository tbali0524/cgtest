Often times, when confronted with a large line of urinals, you must find the open urinal that is furthest away from all other occupied urinals in order to minimize awkwardness. (See https://blog.xkcd.com/2009/09/02/urinal-protocol-vulnerability/ for inspiration)

Write a program that accepts information about a line of urinals and provides the correct urinal index to use.
