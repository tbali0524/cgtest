This program problem is to replace the characters in a multi-line string [[m]] of [[n]] lines of length [[n]].

A <<string>> [[s]] is an indication of the character to be replaced and the character after the replacement.

For example, If {{ox xx}} indicated, In this case, {{o}} is replaced by {{x}}. however the case like {{xx}} the same character indicated will be ignored.

In answer, you should <<output the final figure of the string>>.

The final figure of the string is the figure in which all letters have been replaced.

For example, If {{ab bt tz}} indicated (in any order), the letter {{a}} in the figure must all be {{z}} in the final figure of the string.

A set of substitutions is valid if the replacing process is well defined and eventually finishes. If the given set is not valid, output {{ERROR}}.

Below are some example problems. (You can skip the example problems. )

Example1:

`
ox xx pq
3
owe
uax
oqp
`

In this case, To replace {{o}} with {{x}} and {{p}} with {{q}}.
Thus, the answer is

`
xwe
uax
xqq
`

Example2:

`
ww aa zz oo ii
3
waz
oiw
stw
`

In this case, there is no particular  replace.
Therefore, the answer is

`
waz
oiw
stw
`

Example3:

`
zy yd da ao
5
zzzzz
yyyyy
ddddd
aaaaa
ooooo
`

In this case, {{z}}, {{y}}, {{d}}, and {{a}} all characters end up replacing {{o}}.
Thus, the answer is

`
ooooo
ooooo
ooooo
ooooo
ooooo
`

Example4:

`
gu uy yy yu
4
gggg
uuuu
yyyy
uuuu
`

In this case, {{g}} replaces to {{u}} and {{u}} replaces to {{y}}. But since {{y}} replaces to {{u}}, it is a permanent loop.
Therefore, the output is {{ERROR}} as the answer.

Example5:

`
ge sc xi xk
5
sfghh
kindd
xzjtk
uilob
otrne
`

In this case, {{x}} can replace {{i}} or {{k}} in a two patterns, which is inconsistent.
Therefore, the output is {{ERROR}} as the answer.
