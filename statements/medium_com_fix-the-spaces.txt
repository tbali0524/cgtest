A contribution by Rafarafa

You are given two strings, the first contains the [[original]] sentence, with words in the right order but no spaces. The second has the [[words]] in random order but with spaces to differentiate them. Fix the original sentence by adding spaces where they should be.

Every test has <<at least>> one solution, but there are some cases where the original sentence <<can not unambiguously>> be deciphered. In those cases print {{Unsolvable}}.

<<NB:>> Tests 1-14 cover simple cases and should help you debug your program. Tests 15-16 check the performance.
