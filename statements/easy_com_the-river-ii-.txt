A digital river is a sequence of numbers where every number is followed by the same number plus the sum of its digits. In such a sequence 123 is followed by 129 (since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6), which again is followed by 141.

We call a digital river river K, if it starts with the value K.

For example, river 7 is the sequence beginning with {7, 14, 19, 29, 40, 44, 52, ... } and river 471 is the sequence beginning with {471, 483, 498, 519, ... }.

Digital rivers can meet. This happens when two digital rivers share the same values. River 32 meets river 47 at 47, while river 471 meets river 480 at 519.

Given a number decide, whether it can be a meeting point of two or more digital rivers. For example, it is easy to check that only river 20 contains the number 20 in its sequence (as a starting point).
