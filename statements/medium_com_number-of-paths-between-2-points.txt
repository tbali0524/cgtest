A contribution by Xavier_Kress

Given a two dimensional array representing a map, find the total number of paths between two opposite points (0,0) and (N-1,M-1). You can only move from left to right and from top to bottom. Value 0 means that you are free to go on a cell, value 1 is a non reachable cell
