You are walking on a 6-sided die one side per step. Your initial position on this cube is described by a 3-[[line]] string such as
`
 1
2354
 6
`
where
1. the first [[line]] has one whitespace and then the number on the side in front of you
2. the second [[line]] has four numbers of the sides
    a. to your left
    b. that you're on
    c. to your right
    d. opposite you and
3. the third [[line]] has one whitespace and then the number on the side behind you.

That is, in this example, you are standing on 3, going forward takes you to 1, left to 2, right to 5 and backward to 6.

You need to follow a string [[commands]] encoding movements by the characters {{U}}, {{L}}, {{D}}, {{R}} where {{U}} is forward, {{L}} is left, {{D}} is backward and {{R}} is right.

Left and right turns and moving backward also change your orientation. That is, you will always arrive on the next side with the previous side directly behind you.

For example, with the starting position given above, if you are given [[commands]]="DLU", then first you move backward to 6, then left to 5 and finally forward to 1.
