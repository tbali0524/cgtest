A contribution by Silmaen

The Syracuse Conjecture concerns a sequence of integers defined as follows:

`- start with any positive integer n. 
- Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: 
   * if the previous term is even
        the next term is one half the previous term. 
   * If the previous term is odd
        the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.`
The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

For example, given the input 22, the following sequence is constructed: 22 11 34 17 52 26 13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

Given an input [[n]], it is possible to determine the number of terms in the sequence, including the terminating 1. For a given [[n]], this is called the <<cycle-length>> of [[n]].

In the example above, the cycle-length of {{22}} is {{16}}.

For any two numbers [[A]] and [[B]] you are to determine the maximum cycle-length over all numbers between them.
