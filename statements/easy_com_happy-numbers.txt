A <<happy number>> is defined by the following process: 
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are <<happy>> numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are <<unhappy>> numbers.

Given a list of numbers, classify each of them as happy or unhappy.
