Wizarding is a full-time job when you're an elf. Collecting ingredients, refining spells, mixing potions, uncursing travellers…

At the end of a busy day's work, elven wizards like to gather together at the magic tavern and play hooch clash. A clash works as follows:

• the current king of the hill picks two glowing orbs and places them side by side on the table
• the challenger picks two sparkling orbs and places them opposite
• the bartender empties the hooch from each contender's orbs into a cauldron

If the glowing and sparkling liquids are provided in the exact same volume, the clash is <<valid>> and the winner is determined by fair coin toss. A valid clash is deemed <<fun>> if the four orbs on the table have a different size. A fun clash is as <<interesting>> as the challenger's two orbs are heterogeneous (different-sized), as measured by their outside, sparkling, surface area.

This tavern only has orbs of integral diameter from [[orbSizeMin]] to [[orbSizeMax]]. As many of each as you want, it's magic!

Can you help the challenger make a valid clash? Can you make it fun and interesting too?

<<Examples>>
A clash opposing {9,10} to {1,12} is fun: all orbs are different-sized.
A clash opposing {5,7} to {5,7} is valid: the contenders brought up equal volumes of glowing and sparkling hooch.
A clash opposing {1,2} to {2,2} is possible: at least three size-2 orbs are available.

Assuming you could use them for a fun clash, challenging using {31,37} would be <<more>> interesting than using {25,32}.
