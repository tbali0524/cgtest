You must find a substring corresponding to a DNA sequence [[gene]] inside another DNA sequence [[chr]].
Because every individual is different, the [[gene]] can have [[delta]] differences of swapped characters with the aligned [[chr]].

If the last characters of [[genes]] are out of the bounds of [[chr]] (chr is too short), it counts as a delta corresponding to the missing characters. No other removal or insertion of characters is allowed.

For example if [[gene]] is {{AATTAATTAATT}} and you only have one [[chr]] which is {{GAATTAACCAATTGGGGGGGGGG}} and the authorized [[delta]] is {{3}} then the output should be :
{{0 1 2}}
- {{0}} because it is the first (and only) [[chr]] matching
- {{1}} because the [[gene]] starts at the 2nd character of the [[chr]]
- {{2}} because 2 errors (delta) exists in the match ({{CC}} instead of {{TT}})
