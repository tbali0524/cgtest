You are building a bookcase of a certain [[height]] and [[width]], with a certain [[numberOfShelves]]:
â€¢ Except for the decorative top, you will use only the underline ({{_}}) and pipe ({{|}}) characters (and of course spaces) to do this.
â€¢ Divide the bookcase into <<as evenly distributed>> shelf-spaces <<as possible>>.
â€¢ If some have to be larger, put those below the others so they can hold the bigger heavier books.
		
NOTES: 
â€¢ The decorative top of the bookcase (which is included in the [[height]] measurement) does <<not>> count as a shelf.
â€¢ The bottom of the bookcase <<does>> count as a shelf.
â€¢ For simplicity, assume a shelf itself doesn't take up any space.

The decorative top consists of {{/}} on the left side and {{\}} on the right side, and a single {{^}} in the middle if needed.
