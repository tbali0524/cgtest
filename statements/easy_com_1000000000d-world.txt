You are in 1000000000D World!
In 1000000000D World all vectors consist of <<exactly>> one billion integers.

People of 1000000000D World are quite smart and they know that due to low entropy and "curse of dimensionality" most of their billion-dimensional vectors have a lot of consequent repetitions. So they <<always>> store their vectors in a compressed form.
```
For example consider a vector in canonical form: 

[1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... (999999995 times 3)]

In <<compressed form>> it will become just:

[3 1 2 2 999999995 3]    (which stands for 3 times 1 and 2 times 2 and 999999995 times 3)
```

Given two 1000000000D vectors [[A]] and [[B]] in compressed form. 
<<Find a dot product of two vectors>>

Dot product definition:
For two vectors a = [a_1 a_2 ... a_n] and b = [b_1 b_2 ... b_n] dot product <<"a â€¢ b">> = a_1 * b_1 + a_2 * b_2 + ... + a_n * b_n
