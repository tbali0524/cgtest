Among a group of people, will you be able to find the liars?
They each give you a sentence to analyze.

All [[N]] people give you one single sentence.
A <<sentence>> is stated like: {{NUM>NUM>NUM[...]=(T or L)}}
Where {{NUM}} is a person number. You can have up to a hundred of recursive {{NUM>}}.
The Regex of a sentence is {{\d(>\d)*=[TL]}}

{{T}} represents "Truth" and {{L}} represents "Lying".
That can be translated by:
<<{{NUM}} told that {{NUM}} told me that {{NUM}} [...] {{NUM}} is telling the truth/is lying>>

The people are numbered from 0 to 9.
If someone is lying, then he inverses everything he says (truth became lie and lie became truth).
If someone is telling the truth, then for him everything he said is correct.

For every case, there is only one single solution.

<<Examples:>>
{{2>0=L}}: 2 told that 0 is lying
{{2>3>0=T}}: 2 told that 3 told me that 0 is telling the truth

<<Explanation of the first exemple case :>>
If 0 is saying the truth, then 1 must lie {{0>1=L}}
But if 1 lie, 2 must lie too {{1>2=T}} (a liar say that 2 is telling the truth)
If 0 tell the truth, there is 2 liars, but it is impossible, so 0 is the liar.
