According to Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice):

"Opposite sides of a modern die traditionally add up to seven, requiring the 1, 2, and 3 faces to share a vertex. The faces of a die may be placed clockwise or counterclockwise about this vertex. If the 1, 2, and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called "right-handed". If those faces run clockwise, the die is called "left-handed"."

You are given a die. You need to decide if it is {{right-handed}} or {{left-handed}}. If opposite sides don't add up to 7, we will say that the die is {{degenerate}}.
