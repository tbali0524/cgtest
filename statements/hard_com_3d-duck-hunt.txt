Goal
You’ve Got One Shot!
As an elite hunter, you’ve tracked three rogue ducks fleeing through 3D space.
Your final bullet is special: it can be fired at any speed from any position.
Can you calculate a position and a single speed vector to hit all three ducks in one shot?

Duck Trajectories
Each duck’s position and velocity are given in the format:
x y z @ vx vy vz
Position: Starting coordinates (x, y, z)
Velocity: Speed per second in each direction (vx, vy, vz)
Duck 1: 2 4 3 @ -1 2 0
Example: After 1 second, it moves to [1, 6, 3].
Duck 2: -8 7 0 @ 2 1 1
Duck 3: -4 13 -18 @ 1 0 4

Rules
Your bullet starts at a position and travels at constant speed.
A duck is hit if the bullet’s position matches its position at the same time.

Example Solution
If you fire a bullet at [-4, 7, 0] with speed [1, 1, 1]:
Hits Duck 1 at [-1, 10, 3] after 3 seconds.
Hits Duck 2 at [0, 11, 4] after 4 seconds.
Hits Duck 3 at [2, 13, 6] after 6 seconds.
Boom! All ducks down with one bullet.

Your Task
Find position and speed vector for your bullet that intersects all three ducks at some point in time.

Input
line 1: Duck 1 data, formatted as x y z @ vx vy vz, separated by space.
line 2: Duck 2 data, same format.
line 3: Duck 3 data, same format.

Output
line 1: x y z vx vy vz for your bullet. 6 numbers separated by space.

Constraints
All coordinates and velocities are integers.
The ducks’ velocity vectors are linearly independent in 3D space. (i.e.: the 3 vectors don't share a same plane, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence)

every number is within range (-2^49, 2^49)

Example

Input
2 4 3 @ -1 2 0
-8 7 0 @ 2 1 1
-4 13 -18 @ 1 0 4

Output
-4 7 0 1 1 1
