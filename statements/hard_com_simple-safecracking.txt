Goal
Find the safe combination. The only thing you find lying next to the safe is a note with a message that looks like gibberish.

Oh yeah, if you try to open the safe with the wrong combination, all your files on your computer will be deleted! (not really)

Good luck!

Input
Line 1:An encrypted message.

Output
A single line containing the decrypted safe combination in numeral format.

Example

Input
Aol zhml jvtipuhapvu pz: zpe-mvby-zpe-mvby-aoyll

Output
64643
