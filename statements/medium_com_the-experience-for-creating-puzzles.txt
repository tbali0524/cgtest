A contribution by BlitzProg

BlitzProg adapts himself to the new experience system. To stand a chance against the top end tier Codingamers, he now needs to create puzzles.

BlitzProg solves his own puzzles once they get accepted to maximise experience gain, for a total of 300xp per puzzles.

The xp needed to reach the next level is ( NextLevel * Sqrt(NextLevel) * 10 ), rounded down.

You're given the current [[Level]] and [[XP]] needed for BlitzProg to level up. Your goal is to find out what these stats will be after [[N]] of his puzzles are approved.
