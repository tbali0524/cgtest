Your task is to output the [[screen]] of a calculator when a [[key]] is pressed. For example:
-Input {{3}}: Output {{3}}
-Input {{4}}: Output {{34}}
-Input {{+}}: Output {{34}}
-Input {{2}}: Output {{2}}
-Input {{3}}: Output {{23}}
-Input {{-}}: Output {{57}}
-Input {{4}}: Output {{4}}
-Input {{=}}: Output {{53}}
-Input {{AC}}: Output {{0}}

The calculator doesn't take into account the priority of the operators. If the user presses:
{{2 + 3 x 5}}
the final output will be {{25}}
The user may press two operation keys consecutively. In that case, the operation that must be taken into account is the second one.
If the result has decimal numbers, it must be output with, at most, 3 decimal places. Otherwise, it must be output without a decimal point. Decimal numbers are also stored rounded with 3 decimal places.
If the user presses the {{=}} key consecutively, the last operation should be performed repeatedly. For example, {{1 0 - 3 = = =}} is the same as calculating {{10 - 3 - 3 - 3}}.
