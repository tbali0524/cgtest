A contribution by JBM

Casablanca’s hippodrome has grown tired of old-fashioned dual racing and has kicked it up a notch: they will now be organizing hyperduals.

During a hyperdual, only two horses will participate in the race. In order for the race to be interesting, it is necessary to try to select two horses with similar strength.

Write a program which, using a given number of strengths, identifies the two closest strengths and shows their difference with an integer.

In a hyperdual, a horse's strength is a bidimensional [[(Velocity,Elegance)]] vector. The distance between two strengths [[(V1,E1)]] and [[(V2,E2)]] is [[abs(V2-V1)+abs(E2-E1)]].

(This is a harder version of training puzzle “Horse-racing duals”. You may want to solve that problem first.)
(To date there is no specific achievement if you solve this one in pure bash. Rest assured it *is* possible nonetheless!)
