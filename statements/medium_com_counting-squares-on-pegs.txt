A contribution by Niako

A farmer wishes to delimit a <<square plot of land>> in his field by setting up a square fence. To this end, he needs to place {{4}} pegs at the {{4}} (distinct) corner positions beforehand. The pegs can only be placed at some given positions where the ground has the appropriate softness (not too hard so that it is possible to hammer the pegs deep enough, but not too soft so that the pegs support the fence without falling).

Given the possible <<integer positions>> for the pegs, <<in how many ways can the farmer pick {{4}} distinct positions to form a square?>>

Note that we do <<not require>> the squares to be <<axis-aligned>>.
