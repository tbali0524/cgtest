At CarAI, we produce solutions for the automotive industry. In this project, we are developing a parking pilot that can work on different brands of vehicles.

The system includes ultrasonic sensors placed at the four corners of the vehicle and a control unit to which they are connected.

Your mission is to develop an algorithm that finds all available park spaces for a vehicle which has just arrived. Below is an illustration for explanation:
```
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx park space
xxxxxxxx=============...
1------1
|--car-|  --->
1------1
xxxxxxxx=============...
xxxxxxxx park space
xxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxx
```
The system can be integrated into different vehicle models. That is why we cannot give you the length of the vehicle. In order for you to calculate it more accurately, a vehicle is not allowed to park near the entrance (denoted as "x" above).

At the start, the back of the vehicle is at index 0. The sensors collect data at that moment, and every time when the vehicle has moved forward 1 unit. The scanning width of each sensor is 1 unit. You are now provided with all the collected data for your development of the algorithm.
