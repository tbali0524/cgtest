When two famous people get together and form a romantic couple, the Tabloids love to write about them and their adventures, scandals, and relationship drama.


The reporters combine (smoosh) their two individual names together to create a <<Couple-Name>> -- just for fun and to make it easier to write about them.  Examples: 
`💕 Ben + Jennifer = Bennifer
💕 Brad + Angelina = Brangelina
💕 Heidi + Spencer = Speidi`
Given the following rules, print out options for each couple.

<<RULES:>>
The overall process is: 
Smoosh a left-substring (or whole name) of one person together with a right-substring (or whole name) of the other person, in such a way that there is at least 1 <<overlapping>>-letter (aka shared letter, aka common letter).
➤ Comparisons aren't case-sensitive.
➤ No spelling changes other than “sub-stringing”
➤ Must contain at least one letter from each person, that isn't part of the overlapping-letter(s).
➤ Must not be shorter than the shortest individual-name.
➤ Cannot be the same as either of the individual names because that's just silly

Only Max Overlapping:
➤ Include only Couple-Names with the <<most>> overlapping-letters <<possible>>.  For example, if there is a Couple-Name that has 2 overlapping-letters, don't show others that have less than 2 overlapping-letters.

Formatting:
➤ A Couple-Name has only the first letter capitalized, regardless of the capitalization in the individual names.
➤ Where there are multiple options, list them alphabetically on the same line separated by spaces.
➤ If no options, print {{NONE}}


Sorry I can't help more, but Keanu Reeves and I are headed out on some excellent "Lisanu" adventures, on a luxury yacht in Cannes.
Or maybe Eddie Mark Jacobson and I (“Eddisa”) will have a Big Night Out on the Gold Coast.
