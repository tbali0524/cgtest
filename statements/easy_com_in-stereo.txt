A time machine with an empty gas tank leaves you stranded in a 1990s shopping mall, with nothing the locals recognize as money. The only commodity you can release without ruining the timeline are those stereogram posters sometimes known by the trade name "Magic Eye". Can you sell enough 3D art to top up the tank and get back to modern life?

Start with a base [[pattern]] (which wraps around), a [[stock]] of extra symbols to fill in when the pattern needs to grow, and a [[depth map]].

For each line in the depth map, start at the beginning of the original pattern with the original stock and at a depth of {{0}}.

For each character in the depth map:
1. If the depth is higher, decrease the pattern by removing characters at the current position.
  If the depth is lower, increase the pattern by moving characters from the stock into the current position.
2. Output the pattern character at the current position.
3. Advance to the next pattern position, wrapping around if you reach the end.

For example, if the pattern is {{ABCD}}, the stock is {{UVWX}}, and the depth map is {{23200}}:

`        | Current | New   | Change   |          | New     |       |
Pattern | Depth   | Depth | in Depth | Action   | pattern | Stock | Output
--------+---------+-------+----------+----------+---------+-------+-------
<<A>>BCD    | 0       | 2     | +2       | Remove 2 | <<C>>D      | UVWX  | C
C<<D>>      | 2       | 3     | +1       | Remove 1 | <<C>>       | UVWX  | C
<<C>>       | 3       | 2     | -1       | Add 1    | <<U>>C      | VWX   | U
U<<C>>      | 2       | 0     | -2       | Add 2    | U<<V>>WC    | X     | V
UV<<W>>C    | 0       | 0     | 0        | Nothing  | UV<<W>>C    | X     | W`
<<bold>> indicates current position in pattern

Because of length limitations for test cases, the examples below are too narrow to see easily.

(Zoom out until the lines do not wrap. Use the parallel "wall-eyed" viewing technique, not cross-eyed.)
