THEY put you in a square shape room, with [[N]] meters on each side.
THEY want to know everything about you.
THEY are observing you.
THEY placed some candles in the room. 

Every candle makes [[L]] "light" in the spot they are, and every spot in square shape gets one less "light" as the next ones. If a spot is touched by two candles, it will have the larger "light" it can have. Every spot has the base light of 0.

You can hide only, if you find a dark spot which has 0 "light". 
<< How many dark spots you have? >>

You will receive a map of the room, with the empty places (X) and Candles (C) in [[N]] rows, each character separated by a space.

Example for the light spread [[N]] = 5, [[L]] = 3:
X X X X X
X C X X X
X X X X X
X X X X X
X X X X X
