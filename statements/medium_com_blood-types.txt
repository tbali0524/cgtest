Your blood type is comprised of two blood groups: ABO  (A, B, AB, or O) and Rh (+ or -), which are inherited from parents.

Inheritance is closely related to the genes pairing mechanism. Each person has two genes to determine his/her ABO blood type, as listed below:

`AA = A blood type
AO = A blood type
BB = B blood type
BO = B blood type
OO = O blood type
AB = AB blood type`

Each biological parent donates one of two ABO genes to their child. For example, a parent of O blood type with genes OO and a parent of A blood type with genes AA will have a child with one A gene and one O gene (AO), which is an A blood type.

Suppose the A blood type parent in the above example is having genes AO, it is possible to have a child of blood type either A or O.

<<Rh Factor>>
Rh factor refers to a protein that may be found on the covering of red blood cells. If your red blood cells have this protein, you are Rh+. Otherwise, you are Rh-.

Just as everyone inherits ABO genes, every person inherits one Rh gene from each biological parent, which finally determines whether the Rh protein is present.

`++ = Rh+
+- = Rh+
-- = Rh-`

Combining ABO type and Rh factor, there are eight blood types:
<<A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O->>

We use this expression to describe the blood type inheritance relationship:
parent + parent = child

There are 3 variables in the equation. Two variables will be given. You are going to determine all possible values in the unknown variable.

For example, A- + O+ = ?
Answer is A+, A-, O+, O-
