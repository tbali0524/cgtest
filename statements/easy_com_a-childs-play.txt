For several years now, in elementary schools, we have seen the emergence of a new educational model, playful programming. The students must program a small robot using assembly blocks. This allows them to get familiar with programming from an early age while exercising their logic and perception of space.

You are a student at one such school. The purpose of the exercise is simple: your teacher has crafted a circuit for your robot, told you how many moves [[n]] the robot may make, and <<you must find out the final position of the robot at end of execution.>>

To do this you need to know some principles of robot operation.
– When the robot encounters an obstacle (represented by {{#}}) it turns right (on same operation) until there's no obstacle ahead anymore. Otherwise on an empty area (represented by {{.}}) it moves straight ahead.
– The robot initially moves upwards.
– The robot stops after [[n]] moves.
– The top left corner represents the coordinates (0,0)
– The robot's environment is represented as follows, where {{O}} is the robot's initial position:
`...#........
...........#
............
............
..#O........
..........#.`
