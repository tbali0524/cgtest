In this simplified version of "Card Counting", you are playing Blackjack at a casino table that uses only one standard deck of 52 cards.

Fortunately, you have an amazing memory and incredible math skills.
Unfortunately, you are easily distracted and there's a lot going on.

Your [[streamOfConsciousness]] is what you observe intermingled with your thoughts.
Each thought or observation (separated by a period {{.}}) might be a series of cards or something else. It is a series of cards if it consists solely of valid cards; see abbreviations used below.

With your knowledge of all the observed cards, calculate the [[percentageChance]] (rounded to the nearest whole number) that the value of the next card will be <<less than>> the [[bustThreshold]].
(The [[bustThreshold]] is what would make your hand "go-bust"/lose by going over 21. It isn't anything you need to calculate; it is provided.)

<<Abbreviations used, and values:>>
• {{K}} = King
• {{Q}} = Queen
• {{J}} = Jack
• {{T}} = Ten
(each of the above has a value of 10)
• {{A}} = Ace (has a value of 1)
• Each number card ({{2}} through {{9}}, inclusive) has its own face value

<<Examples:>>
• <<JT7A44>> means: a Jack, a Ten, a 7, an Ace, and two 4s
• <<JAKE>> might be your buddy, but it's not a series of cards, since "E" isn't a valid abbreviation
• <<AT&T>> might be your cell-service provider, but it's not a series of cards, since "&" isn't a valid abbreviation
• <<T1>> might be a data/telecom line, but it's not a series of cards, since "1" isn't a valid abbreviation
