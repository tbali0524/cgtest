There are three frogs sitting on a two-dimensional plane. The ith frog starts at coordinates [[xi]], [[yi]]. Whenever the ith frog jumps, it jumps in such a way that each of its coordinates either remains unchanged or it changes by exactly [[ki]]. If all three frogs can eventually meet at the same coordinates, print "Possible". Otherwise, print "Impossible".

<<Jumping example:>>
If a frog is at (4,0) and its jumping distance (k) is 2. Then during the next step the frog can be at one of the nine positions: (4,0), (4,2), (4,-2), (6,0), (6,2), (6,-2), (2,0), (2, 2), (2,-2).
