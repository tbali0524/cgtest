Goal
You are given a set of line segments, and your goal is to compute a cyclic continuous curve that:
* does not intersect any endpoint of a segment
* intersects every segment at least once
* minimizes the number of intersections
Your algorithm should return said minimum number of intersections.

Two examples are given at https://imgur.com/a/8kUNhS6, a valid and optimal one and an invalid one crossing an endpoint.

The cyclic curve may self-intersect when necessary. This does not count as crossing a line segment.

Input
Line 1: An integer n, the number of segments in S
n next lines : four integers x1 y1 x2 y2 describing a segment of S with two endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)

Output
Line 1: The minimum number of segments that should be crossed in a cyclic curve that crosses every segment at least once.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 25
1 <= xi, yi <= 100
Two segments may meet at one of their endpoints. They never cross, overlap, intersect, or touch midway.
No segment reduces to a point: for every segment, the two endpoints are distinct.

Example

Input
3
0 0 10 10
10 10 10 0
0 0 10 0

Output
4
