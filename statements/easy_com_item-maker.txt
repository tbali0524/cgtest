Goal
You are programming a new game, but you have to create an interface for your items. Unfortunately, the amount of data is high, and you have to write a program to automate it.

Create an ASCII art of the data to add it to the game later. The frame to output depends on itemRarity.

The patterns are the followings:

##############
# -ItemName- #
#   Common   #
##############

/############\
# -ItemName- #
#    Rare    #
\############/

/------------\
| -ItemName- |
|    Epic    |
\____________/

X----\__/----X
[ -ItemName- ]
| Legendary  |
X____________X


Notes:

- ItemName and ItemRarity have to be centered on the item
- To center a text, the extra space goes to the left:
"  CenteredText "

- ItemName specific line only goes for the Legendary ItemRarity items.
- Legendary items first line depends on the length of the box:
odd: X---\_/---X (1 _ in the middle)
even: X---\__/---X (2 _ in the middle)

Input
Line 1: A string data the data to convert into an item in the format of itemName,itemRarity,attribute1:value1,attribute2:value2…

Output
The ASCII art of the item ready to be added to the game.
Attribute order must follow input sequence

Constraints
5 ≤ length of itemName or attribute or value ≤ 100
itemRarity is always Common, Rare, Epic, or Legendary

Example

Input
Wooden Sword,Common,Damage:20

Output
##################
# -Wooden Sword- #
#     Common     #
# Damage 20      #
##################

Difficulty
Easy
