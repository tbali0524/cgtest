Find the {{n}}th term in the sequence starting with S({{0}}) = [[start]] and defined by the rule:

Given a term in the sequence, S(i), the next term, S(i+1) can be found by counting the letters (ignoring whitespace) in the spelled-out binary representation of S(i).

As an example, starting from {{5}} (S({{0}}) = 5), we convert to the binary representation, 101, then spell it out as an English string "one zero one", and count the letters which yields 10 (S({{1}}) = 10).
