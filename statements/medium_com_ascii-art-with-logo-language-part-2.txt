Your job is to extend the Logo language developed in <<ASCII Art with Logo Language>> by giving the Turtle the ability to move diagonally and some new commands (to check your first implementation's resiliency to the never-ending dance of changing requirements).

Commands from part one (not modified):
<<CS>> {{character}}: CLEARSCREEN. Clears the screen with the specified symbol (only printable ASCII excluding space).
<<FD>> {{times}}: FORWARD. Moves Turtle forward for number of times specified (only positive integer).
<<PU>>: PENUP. Sets the Turtle to move without drawing.
<<PD>>: PENDOWN. Turtle leaves a symbol when moving.

Modified commands:
<<SETPC>> {{pen}}: uses cyclically the characters in {{pen}} as Turtle pen, changing every Turtle's step (of length 1) with pen down. Default value for {{pen}} is {{#}}. {{;}} {{[}} {{]}} can't be used in {{pen}}. The index for cycling characters resets each time you use SETPC.
<<RT>> {{angle}}: RIGHT. Turns Turtle right for number of degrees specified (only positive multiples of 45).
<<LT>> {{angle}}: LEFT. Turns Turtle left for number of degrees specified (only positive multiples of 45).

New command:
<<RP>> {{loop}} {{<<[>>commands<<]>>}}: REPEAT. This instruction repeats the commands that are inside the square brackets the number of times indicated by the {{loop}} parameter.

For example: `RP 2 [FD 2]` is equivalent to `FD 2;FD 2`
REPEAT command can be nested. For example: `RP 2 [RP 2 [RT 90;FD 2]]` is equivalent to `RT 90;FD 2;RT 90;FD 2;RT 90;FD 2;RT 90;FD 2`
`setpc 12345;rt 90;fd 5`
produces
{{12345}}

As in part one, Turtle starts heading North, with the pen down and the initial symbol set to {{#}}.
