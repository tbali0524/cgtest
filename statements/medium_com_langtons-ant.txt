Langton's ant is a turing machine built on simple rules:
• Consider a grid of [[W]]x[[H]] squares, each of which can be either black {{#}} or white {{.}}.
• The ant starts at the position ([[x]], [[y]]) of the grid, the upper left square coordinates are (0,0).
• The ant is facing one of the following directions ({{N}} = up, {{E}} = right, {{S}} = down, {{W}} = left).
• The ant moves [[T]] turns. For each turn:
　　- it rotates 90° left if it is on a white square, 90° right otherwise.
　　- it inverts the color of the square it is located on.
　　- it moves 1 square forward in its current direction.

From an arbitrarily coloured grid and the ant's initial state, you have to print the grid state after [[T]] turns.

On the given test cases, the ant never has to go out of bounds.
