You might know Fermat’s small theorem:
If [[n]] is prime, then for any integer [[a]], we have [[a^n]] ≡ [[a]] mod [[n]], that means that [[a^n]] and [[a]] have the same remainder in the euclidian division by [[n]].

There are numbers, called Carmichael numbers, that are not prime but for which the equality remains true for any integer [[a]].
For example, 561 is a Carmichael numbers because for any integer [[a]], [[a^561]] ≡ [[a]] mod [[561]]. It’s in fact the smallest Carmichael number.

You have to tell if the given number is a Carmichael number or not. Beware, you might be given a prime number.
