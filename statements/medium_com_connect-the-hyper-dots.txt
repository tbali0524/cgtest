A contribution by davilla

A collection of labeled points is provided in [[<<n>>]]-dimensional space. <<Starting at the origin>>, find the nearest point, and then the <<nearest unused point>> from that point, and so on until all points have been connected.

The concatenated labels <<within an orthant>> spell a word. Therefore, these words need to be <<spaced>> when <<crossing some axis>>, that is, when entering a new orthant.

Some points labeled with punctuation will have a zero coordinate. In the tests, the hyphen in {{criss-cross}} is an example. A zero coordinate is not considered crossing the axis. Thus, do not add a space except when the sign change is fully within a new orthant from previous.
