A contribution by Grarzyna

The goal of this exercise is to add two lengths with given metric units.
To calculate it properly you first need to convert them to the same unit. 
Present the result using the smaller unit.

For instance:
<<4cm + 2dm>>
must convert 2dm to 20cm:
<<4cm + 20cm>>
it then results to:
<<24cm>>

If you like to challenge yourself a little more...
Try to limit the number of <<ifs>> and <<switches>> as much as possible in your code.
