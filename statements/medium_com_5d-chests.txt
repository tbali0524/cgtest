Pirx the Pilot is flying his spaceship through hyperspace in search of gold.  Given a 5D realm with all dimensions ranging from 1 to N, each location (x,y,z,w,v) is either a chest of gold (1) or a barrier (0) as determined by the function:

f(x,y,z,w,v)=isprime(1+ mod(x*y*z*w*v,C)) 

The barriers form rooms in hyperspace (Pirx can only move along the five dimensions, no diagonals). Help Pirx search every room and find all the gold.
