<<Dolbear's law>> states the relationship between the <<air temperature>> and the <<rate at which crickets chirp>> (source: Wikipedia).

Dolbear expressed the relationship as the following formula, which provides a way to estimate the temperature <<TC>> in degrees Celsius from the number of chirps per minute, called [[N60]]:
<<TC>> = {{10}} + ([[N60]] - {{40}}) / {{7}}.

Another method is to count the number of chirps in <<8>> seconds, called [[N8]], and add {{5}}
(this is fairly accurate between {{5}} and {{30}}Â°C):
<<TC>> = [[N8]] + {{5}}.

We are in August and it is very hot.
With the help of Jiminy Cricket, you want to estimate the air temperature while staying cool at home.
You then take a stopwatch, a pencil and a paper, and every {{4}} seconds, you note the number of chirps of Jiminy.

For example, if you noted the following series: <<3 2 3>>, then Jiminy chirped <<3>> times in the first 4 seconds, then <<2>> times in the next 4 seconds, and finally <<3>> times in the last 4 seconds.

In order to have a good estimate of the air temperature, you take a lot of measurements: one measure every {{4}} seconds during [[M]] minutes.

Once you're done with the measurements, you can compute the estimated temperature using the correct formula!
Unfortunately, Jiminy chirps whenever he wants, driving you crazy and distorting your calculations... so do not take your results too seriously!
