Goal
Given a grid of integers, where each integer represents the height of a cell, find all peaks (cells higher than all neighbors) and valleys (cells lower than all neighbors). Neighbors include orthogonally and diagonally adjacent cells.

The output is 2 lines:
- Peaks coordinates (x, y) separated by a comma and a space, or NONE if none.
- Valleys coordinates (x, y) separated by a comma and a space, or NONE if none.

Coordinates use (column, row) indexing and are printed in reading order (top to bottom, left to right).

Note: The top-left corner is (0, 0)

Input
Line 1: The number of lines in the grid - h.
Next h lines: A line of the grid.

Output
Line 1: The coordinates for peaks or NONE.
Line 2: The coordinates for valleys or NONE.

Constraints
3 ≤ h, the width of the grid ≤ 10
-10000 ≤ The integers in the grid ≤ 10000

Example

Input

(1, 3)
