Ataria lives on a <<toroidal map>> known as the Mystic Rectangle, where <<opposite edges>> of the map are <<connected>>. Crossing an edge teleports her to the opposite side. Ataria can move in any of the four <<cardinal>> directions or along the four <<diagonals>> of 45 degrees.

Given Ataria's coordinates and the coordinates of the goal, find the fastest [[time]] for her to reach the goal, assuming no obstacles.

Moving East or West ±1 unit in [[x]] takes {{0.3}} seconds.
Moving North or South ±1 unit in [[y]] takes {{0.4}} seconds.
It takes {{0.5}} seconds to move diagonally, 1 unit East/West plus 1 unit North/South.

After travelling for <<1 minute>> in any single cardinal direction (that is, {{200}} units East/West, or {{150}} units North/South), she ends up returning to the same place.


<<Example>>

Suppose Ataria starts near the top of the map and travels diagonally {{15}} units NorthEast and then straight {{5}} units due North. In doing so, she <<wraps around>> to the bottom of the map, arriving at the goal. Then at {{9.5}} seconds, this direct route makes the best [[time]] to the goal.
