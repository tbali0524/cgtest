There is a digital scoreboard showing 2 digits.

(1) First part of input shows the starting score
(2) Second part of input shows what lights will be turned OFF
(3) Third part of the input shows what additional lights will be turned ON

What is the [[newScore]]?

To see example of a digital scoreboard and how each of the 10 digits is displayed, see banner image
