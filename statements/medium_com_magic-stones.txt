You have a number [[N]] of magic stones each of which has a level with a positive integer value.

The stones are very heavy and cumbersome to carry around. 

Luckily you can use your magic powers to combine two stones of level {{i}} to form a single stone of level {{i+1}}. 

Use your power to minimise the number of stones that you have.
