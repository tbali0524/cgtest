You have to decrypt a [[h]] x [[w]] grid of encrypted text.

Each row/column of the grid has its own <<weight>>, which is the sum of the binary representation of its letters in ASCII (A=65, B=66, ...., Z=90). 
For example the row ABCD has a weight of 266 (65 + 66 + 67 + 68). 
The grid only contains uppercase letters from A to Z

To decrypt the grid you'll have to:
First, for each of the [[w]] columns move the letters down a row [[weight of the column]] times
And then, for each of the [[h]] rows move the letters to the column at their right [[weight of the row]] times

The rows/columns form a cycle, if a letter should leave the grid from one side, make it appear at the other side

For example (we'll assume for this example that all the weights are equal to 1): 
ABC
DEF
GHI

The letters of each column move downward <<1>> time:
GHI
ABC
DEF

Then the letters of each row move to the right <<1>> time:
IGH
CAB
FDE

Note that in the tests, each row/columns will have its own <<weight>> !

Repeat this process [[steps]] times and you'll get the decrypted grid of text.
