A contribution by Lisa-Has-Ideas

Secretary of Transportation Pete has asked you to program electronic signs to communicate to drivers that they need to turn left or turn right.

Pete wants lots of options for the signs, so the input is:
• [[direction]] -- which is either {{left}} or {{right}}
• [[howManyArrows]]
• [[heightOfArrows]]
• [[strokeThicknessOfArrows]]
• [[spacingBetweenArrows]]
• [[additionalIndentOfEachLine]] -- this will determine if the shape of the arrows is subtle or more pointy 

However, Pete is also a minimalist, so all that input will be in a single string of data.

Note:
• Left turn signs will consist of {{<}} and spaces only
• Right turn signs will consist of {{>}} and spaces only
