You are given an Othello board and the colour and position of the next turn. You must answer if itâ€™s legal or not.
Othello is a two-player game. Player #1 begins and plays black ({{B}}), and player #2 plays white ({{W}}).
{{B}} player can only put his token near a {{W}} token in order to make at least one {{BW+B}} "sandwich". A sandwich is defined as any number of tokens of one color consecutively in a line (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) which are surrounded on both sides by tokens of the opposite color. Once a sandwich is achieved, all the {{W}} tokens in this sandwich are turned into {{B}}. Repeat this as necessary for each valid sandwich in the eight directions (including diagonals).
Examples (the played token in lower-case):
* {{--bWWWBW}} yields {{---bBBBBW}}.
* {{BBWWWwBW}} yieds {{BBWWWwWW}}.
* {{-WWWw---}} is illegal if there is no sandwich elsewhere.
* {{WWWbBW--}} is illegal too.
Each player must play if possible. If not, he passes his turn.
