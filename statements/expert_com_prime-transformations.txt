Goal
Every integer 2 or greater N has a unique prime factorisation such that
N = P1^Q1 × P2^Q2...
where Pi are ascending prime numbers and Qi are positive power indices.

Examples
30 = (2^1)×(3^1)×(5^1)
96 = (2^5)× (3^1)
900 = (2^2)×(3^2)×(5^2)

Consider a transformation that takes all values in a given finite set of primes and maps each prime to another one (it can be the same prime as before, and not necessarily in the initial set, but no two primes map to the same prime).

For example, take a transformation which has the following mapping:
2 -> 11
3 -> 17
5 -> 2

Then
4 -> 121, (2^2 -> 11^2)
9 -> 289, (3^2 -> 17^2)
25 -> 4, (5^2 -> 2^2)
6 -> 187 ((2^1)×(3^1) -> (11^1)×(17^1))
10 -> 22 ((2^1)×(5^1) -> (11^1)×(2^1))

Your task, given a set of transformed pairs, is to find the transformation and thus apply it to a given integer X.

Input
Line 1: X the integer to transform
Line 2: C the number of clues given about the transformation
Next C Lines: For each line, a pair of integers Ai and Bi such that the transformation maps Ai to Bi

Output
One line containing Y, the result of the transformation applied to X.
Constraints
2 ≤ Ai, Bi, X, Y < 2^63
2 ≤ Pi ≤ 100

Example

Input
16
1
2 5

Output
625
