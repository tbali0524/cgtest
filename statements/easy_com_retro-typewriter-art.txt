A contribution by Lisa-Has-Ideas

Back in the day, people had fun turning "recipes" into surprise images using typewriters.

Use the provided recipe to create a recognizable image.

Chunks in the recipe are separated by a space.
Each chunk will tell you either 
{{nl}} meaning NewLine (aka Carriage Return)
~or~ 
how many of the character and what character

For example:
   {{4z}} means {{zzzz}}
   {{1{}} means {{{}}
   {{10=}} means {{==========}}
   {{5bS}} means {{\\\\\}} (see Abbreviations list below)
   {{27}} means {{77}}
   {{123}} means {{333333333333}}
   (If a chunk is composed only of numbers, the character is the last digit.)

So if part of the recipe is 
{{2* 15sp 1x 4sQ nl}}
...that tells you to show `**               x''''` and then go to a new line.


Abbreviations used:
{{sp}} = space 
{{bS}} = backSlash {{\}}
{{sQ}} = singleQuote {{'}}
and
{{nl}} = NewLine
