Goal
You are Catherine, you know that Alice and Bob are chatting secretly and you want to be the woman in the middle; ie you want to intercept Alice and Bob’s messages, to read them and to send them messages that you cipher in place of theirs. If Alice sent Bob a message, Bob will never receive Alice’s message but yours instead.
You are lucky: you caught a ciphered text and its clear version and you know that they are using the Hill cipher method.
You have to find the Hill matrix in order to decipher a text from Alice or Bob and to cipher the text you want to send instead.

The texts are using the 45 symbols of the alphanumeric encoding of the QR codes:
0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ $%*+-./: (yes, it’s a space between the Z and the $)

How to:
The Hill cipher uses matrix multiplication (here, with a modulus of 45).
For example, you have to cipher CODINGAME. with A, a 2×2 matrix.
CODINGAME. is 12 24 13 18 23 16 10 22 14 42 (because C’s index is 12).

If A is:
⎡6 5⎤
⎣7 6⎦

The first pair of ciphered symbols will be:
6×12+5×24 mod 45 = 192 mod 45 = 12 that is C and 7×12+6×24 mod 45 = 228 mod 45 = 3 that is 3.
Thus, CO is ciphered C3, the product A×T mod 45 where T is the column matrix whose elements are 12 and 24.
Finally, the ciphered text is C3XJ%WZMOZ.

If the matrix’s size is 3, you will cipher 3 characters at a time.

For this puzzle, you have to find the cipher matrix (and its size) and how to decipher.

Input
Line 1: The ciphered text
Line 2: The clear text
Line 3: The ciphered text you have to decipher
Line 4: The clear text you have to cipher

Output
Line 1: Line 3 deciphered
Line 2: Line 4 ciphered

Constraints
You can assume that the size of the cipher matrix divides the length of all the messages (but it’s not 1).

Just to help you:
* The clear texts of a test and validator pair will be the same but the Hill matrix won’t be the same.
* Test 1/validator 1 and test 2/validator 2’s Hill matrices are the same.
* Test 2/validator 2 and test 3/validator 3’s clear texts are the same.
* There are no trailing spaces in the clear texts but there might be some in the ciphered texts (as in the example).

Example

Input
C3XJ%WZMOZ
CODINGAME.
6-85OXC 
HELLO WORLD.

Output
BONJOUR.
