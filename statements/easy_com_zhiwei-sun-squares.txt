Goal
Given a positive integer n, find the number of ordered tuples (a, b, c, d, e) over non-negative integers for which a² + b² + c² + d² = n and b + 3c + 5d = e².

Note: A conjecture by 孙智伟 (Sūn, Zhìwěi) states that this count is always at least 1.

For example, if n is 9, there are 3 solutions, namely:

(0, 0, 3, 0, 3)
(1, 0, 2, 2, 4)
(3, 0, 0, 0, 0)

Input
Line 1: An integer n

Output
Line 1: A count of solutions

Constraints
0 < n < 30 000

Example

Input
9

Output
3

Difficulty
Easy
