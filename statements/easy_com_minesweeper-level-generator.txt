You like to solve Minesweeper levels ? You will love generating them !

<<How to generate a level>>

* A level is a [[width]] x [[ height]] cells grid. Its origin is the top left corner. It contains [[n]] mines.
* The level is generated only when the player selects the first cell. The 3x3 cells square centered on this cell is always set free of mines.
* To generate a mine, X and Y grid coordinates (X first and then Y) are randomly generated until an available position is found. To generate X (resp. Y), use the random value modulo [[width]] (resp. [[height]]).

<<Controlling randomness>>

The random number generator used to generate the level is a pseudo random number generator (PRNG) initialized with a [[seed]] provided in the inputs. The PRNG works as follows:

The nth generated value is:
R(n) = (214013 * R(n-1) + 2531011) / 65536
with R(0) = [[seed]]
R(1) is the first value to use.

With a seed of 31, the expected five first values produced by the PRNG are 139, 492, 1645, 5410, 17705.

You must use a single instance of PRNG for the whole generation. All calculations must be in 32-bit unsigned numbers. Beware that some languages (Python for instance) implicitly generate big integers without overflowing.
