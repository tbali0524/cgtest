You just have got into cardistry and discovered a shuffle named <<Faro shuffle>>
(See {{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNim5GjQ610}} for more details)


<<Faro shuffle>> is done as follow:

<<1. Split>> the deck of cards into two decks of the same size.
(If the original deck has an <<odd>> number of cards the first deck will have one more card than the second deck)
<<2. Merge>> the two decks picking alternatively one card from each, starting with the first deck.


You grab a fresh deck of cards and start practicing this shuffle.
After a while, you wonder if you can create a trick based on this shuffle, a pattern might emerged if you do it a certain number of times.


Given a deck of cards, print out the resulting deck after [[N]] shuffles.
