Each Friday, you play the famous 'Fix your Dungeon' RPG with friends. You'd like to optimize your character: you need to know the probability of success of each test involving dice throws.

Your program takes in input an expression (possibly with dice throws) and must print all possible outcomes along with their probabilities.

The expression is an arithmetic expression <<with parentheses>> and the following operators, from highest to lowest precedence:
{{*}} multiplication
{{+}} and {{-}} addition and subtraction
{{>}} greater-than comparison: evaluates to 1 if true, 0 if false

The operands are one of:
[[n]]: a decimal positive integer
{{d}}[[n]]: a 'd' followed by a strict positive number, representing a die throw from 1 to [[n]] by a uniform distribution

Examples of expressions:
   {{3*2+5}} evaluates to 11 
   {{d6}}: evaluates to an integer from 1 to 6, uniform
   {{d6+d6}}: represents a double-dice throw
   {{5>2}}: evaluates to 1
