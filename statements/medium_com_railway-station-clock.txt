The old clock in the railway station is too ancient to be refurbished but too nice to be replaced with a modern one.
But it is a little slow. To be precise, <<every four minutes it goes behind by one more second>>.

The clock is stable in its delay. In addition the station administrator adjusts the clock <<daily at 8AM>>.
So it's not that bad.
But still all the train events recorded in the official station log are timewise wrong.

You need to create a script to recover <<true times>> having <<times observed from the station clock>> as input.

Please note, you don't need to worry about fractions of a second (all tests are guaranteed to have whole seconds for both <<observed>> and <<true>> times).
