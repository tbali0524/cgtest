Given an ASCII art pattern, cast a shadow as if the light source is at top-left corner to make the pattern 3D-like.
Use <<hyphen (-)>> for darker shadow, and <<backtick (`)>> for lighter one.
Darker shadow is projected by shifting existing pattern 1 character down and 1 character right.
Lighter shadow is projected by shifting existing pattern 2 character down and 2 character right.
