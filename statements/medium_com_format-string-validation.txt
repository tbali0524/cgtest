You are given a line of [[text]] and a "string format". The [[format]] seems to be heavily inspired from <<LIKE clauses from SQL>> and uses two special characters, {{?}} and {{~}}:

{{?}}: Matches exactly one character.
{{~}}: Matches any number of characters, from zero (none) to the entire string.
<<Any other characters:>> Matches exactly that character.

It seems that the format <<does not include escaping special characters>> (good for you!) so {{?}} and {{~}} in [[text]] may only be matched by {{?}} and {{~}} under the right circumstances. The backslash character will match only the backslash character itself.

The [[text]] is considered to {{MATCH}} if the [[format]] describes the [[text]] <<from start to end>> with no characters rejected by the pattern. If it does not match, write {{FAIL}} instead.
