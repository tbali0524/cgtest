The rule here is that you start with an element [[A1]], and whenever you get to a number you have not seen before, the following term is a <<0>>. But if the number [[An]] has appeared previously in the sequence, then you count the number of terms since the last appearance of [[An]], and that number is the following term.

For a series starting with [[A1]] as 0, the series will be:

0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 2, 6, 5, 4, 0, 5, 3, 0, 3, …


Term 1: The first term is 0. 
Term 2: Since we haven’t seen 0 before, the second term is 0.
Term 3: Since we had seen a 0 before, one step back, the third term is 1
Term 4: Since we haven’t seen a 1 before, the fourth term is 0
Term 5: Since we had seen a 0 before, two steps back, the fifth term is 2.

And so on...
