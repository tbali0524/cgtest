You have to correctly interpret [[RPN]] (Reverse Polish Notation) instructions and print the stack when the instruction line has been read (from left to right).
If the instruction is a {{number}}, simply put in on top of the stack (on the right).
The operations ([[ADD]], [[SUB]], [[MUL]], [[DIV]], [[MOD]]) pop the last two numbers out of the stack and push back on top the result. You can safely assume that the numbers are all integers.
For example after, [[2 5 SUB 8]], the stack is [[-3 8]].
[[DIV]] is the integer quotient and [[MOD]] the remainder of the division.
There are also operators that act on the stack itself:
[[POP]] removes the top number.
[[DUP]] duplicates the top number.
[[SWP]] swaps the two top numbers. [[4 5 SWP 6]] swaps {{4}} and {{5}} then pushes {{6}} on top, the stack is [[5 4 6]].
[[3 ROL]] pops the top number (here itâ€™s {{3}}) then brings to the top the third number of the stack. For example, if the stack is [[1 2 3 4]], [[3 ROL]] changes it in [[1 3 4 2]].
